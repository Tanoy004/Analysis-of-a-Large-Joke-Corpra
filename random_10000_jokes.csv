"A retiring obstetrician takes the bag of foreskins he collected during his career to a taxidermist. The taxidermist looks at the thousands of dried up bits of skin and then looks quizzically at the obstetrician -- who says ""I don't know, just make something nice with them.""

A couple months later, the taxidermist calls to say that the souvenir of the obstetrician's career is ready. When the OB gets there, the taxidermist hands him a *wallet*! It is beautifully made, with thousands of tiny stitches, but it's *disappointingly small*.

OB: What? I gave you thousands of foreskins! That's it?

"An Arab is lost in the desert, dying of thirst As his eyesight begins to fade and he collapses into the ground, his fingers come across a stoppered flask in the sand. Hoping for water, he pops it open, only to see a swirl of smoke issued forth, coalescing into a giant figure.

""My deliverer!"" booms the figure. ""I am a long imprisoned Djinn, and as a reward for freeing me, I grant you three wishes.""

""Water!"" gasps the Arab, and in a flash a huge pool of crystal clear water appears before him. He drinks until sated, then falls back to consider his situation.

""Your second wish, my deliverer?"" says the Djinn.

""A palace,"" says the Arab, ""of hundreds of rooms, filled with servants and riches beyond any king."" And as he wished, so it appeared beside the pool of water.

""And your third wish, my deliverer?"" says the Djinn.

The Arab thinks. ""Well, Djinn, with my first wish I secured my life, while my second wish secured my future, and the future of my family. With my third wish, I should like to secure the future of my people, and my country. Therefore, I wish that the country of Israel should be destroyed!""

"A man walks into a restaurant with a rooster under his arm. A limousine stops before a restaurant and a well dressed man steps out, with a rooster under his arm.

After he's shown to a private table, he puts the rooster on the table and orders every item on the menu.

Flabbergasted, the waiter asks: ""Excuse me sir, but are you sure you want all this, it's quite a bit of food.""

Unfazed, the man replies:

""No, no, this is for the bird. For me, just bring me a glass of water and a salad.""

At that point the waiter goes ""the customer is always right"" and starts bringing the mountain of food.

True enough, the rooster starts eating.. and eating.. and eating, slowly making his way trough all that food.

The waiter can no longer contain his curiosity and asks the man what the deal is with that rooster.

The man smiles and answers:

""Well, you see.. a few years ago I was in Egypt and found an old rusted oil lamp. I rub it and lo and behold, a genie jumps out and says I get three wishes.""

""So my first wish was: I want so much money, that I must throw it away, because I don't know where to put it. And I got it.""

""My second wish was: I want so many women, that I must kick them for them to leave them alone. And, heh, I'm well covered in that department.""

The man then sighs and is lost in thought for a while, so the waiter prods him on:

""And the third wish?""

I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not.

"Sam the clam and Larry the lobster are best friends under the ocean... And all they like to do is disco. All day and night, these two would boogey at the local clubs all night and all day. Until, one day, Sam the clam passed away.
Larry the lobster was bummed out, but lived out the rest of his life disco dancing, although alone.
When Larry the lobster passed, his soul flew straight to heaven, because Larry was a good lobster in life. When he arrived at the pearly gates, the Head Angel met with him.
""Larry lobster! Welcome to heaven! We are so excited to have you. I'm the Head Angel, and I will show you around the place. We will have a meeting in about an hour, do you have any questions?""
Larry the lobster thought for a moment then asked ""has my friend Sam the clam been through here?""
The Head Angel grew somber.
""Sam the clam didn't make it into heaven. You can find him in purgatory, if you wish."" 
Before Larry the lobster could zoom off, the Head Angel have him a harp.
""Now don't forget about the meeting in an hour, and be sure to bring your harp.""
So Larry lobster flies off to purgatory, and in the yawning void he spots a bright light. Flying closer he realizes it's a disco bar!
And inside is Sam the clam, in his best disco attire, getting down. They exchange pleasantries and start to dance like the old days. After a while, Larry lobster exclaims ""I have to get back to heaven, I have a meeting!""
So he floors back to heaven and barely makes it on time as all the angels are gathering. 
The Head Angel says ""good afternoon everyone, we are gathered to welcome Larry lobster who... say, Larry, where's your harp?""
To which he replies
""Oh no.. I left my harp in Sam clam's disco.""",NSFW
"Ferrari vs Scooter One sunny day an old gentleman decided to take his little scooter for a nice ride.  He was the type of old man that was nice to everybody and polite as could be. About twenty minutes into his ride he is stopped at a stop light enjoying the cars as they pass when a middle aged business man pulls up beside him in a beautiful red convertible  Ferrari. Being a nice guy he says to the business man, ""sure is a nice car you have there sir.""  Being a pompous dick and not wanting to talk to a lowly old man riding a scooter, the business man flips him off, and rolls up the window.  He then decides, I am gonna show this old man how awesome me and my car really is.  As soon as the light goes green the business man floors the Ferrari attempting to leave him in the dust.  As he takes off the he looks in his rear view mirror and to his amazement he can see the old man on the scooter not far behind and gaining on him.  Not to be made a fool of the business man gives it all he's got accelerating to 100 mph.   He looks in his mirror again expecting the old man to be left behind but to his utter amazement the old man is still close behind and gaining!!  The business man is seriously humbled that this scooter could keep up and decides to stop and admit defeat to the ol coot.  The pair finally come to a stop and the business man rolls his window back down, ""sir I want to apologize for my behavior back there, I shouldn't have flipped you off and thought so poorly about you and your scooter.  You obviously have a good scooter that is just as amazing as my awesome car.""  The old man almost out of breath and heart racing from going so fast says, ""no need to apologize, I was a little upset at first, but when you rolled your window up with my suspenders caught in there you gave me the feelings of excitement and adrenaline I haven't had in years!""",NSFW

The penguin heads to the ice cream shop and orders himself a vanilla cone. He thanks the cashier, and begins eating.

"The Chocolate House One day, Dave had met up with one of his oldest friends Matt, who had just returned from his vacation in Belgium.

They discussed the trip, and what Matt had done in Belgium.

 ""I did quite a lot but the most interesting experience I had was visiting the house of chocolates. It may not have been the best tasting, but you can eat whatever you want!"" Matt said with a wink.

Eventually they part ways and Dave has some time to himself. He realizes that he hasn't been on a vacation in several years, and the house of chocolates is something he would really like to see. So Dave books himself a ticket to Belgium for the following week.

The next week Dave lands in Belgium and takes in the sites. He visits the royal palace of Brussels, Gravensteen, the Atomium and many other touristy destinations. Making sure to leave the house of chocolates as his final sight to see.

The day before he leaves, Dave looks up the address for the house of chocolates but can't find the address. He asks the locals around town, who stick their nose up at him and ignore his request for the address. Until one gentleman overhears Dave asking a young couple where the house of chocolates is.

The man approaches Dave with a smile and says ""I overheard you saying you were looking for the house of chocolates?""

""Yes!"" Dave replies ""Everytime I ask someone though, they become extremely uncomfortable and walk away.""

The man replies saying that it was Belgium's best kept secret and that they didn't like to tell foreigners about it. The man tells Dave the address, and with a smile and a wink says ""Have fun!""

Dave thanks the man and rushes over to the house of chocolates.

As he approaches the house he sees several men leaving the house with large smiles on their faces, clearly very satisfied with their visit.

Dave enters the building, and to his surprise he sees that the walls are lined with old blackboards, with women writing on them with their vaginas.

A little taken back, Dave assumes it must be some sort of Belgian custom he is not familiar with.

He decides to ignore it and heads over to the wall furthest from the door, and punches a hole straight through. He rips off a piece of the wall, and is about to take a bite when a woman approaches him and screams ""What the hell are you doing?! I am the madame of this establishment and we do not tolerate this type of vandalism and behaviour in this establishment!""

The second man, Mark, remembered that he had a box of raisins on the flight. After scouring the wreckage, he found his luggage, and retrieved his fruit.

The third man, Jerry, had the hardest time finding any fruit. As the sun was lowering on the next day, he decided to risk it and steal some fruit from the villagers.

Chris and Mark arrived to the native's hut together with their fruit.

""Now that you have gathered your fruit, you are ready for the second task: You must silently insert all ten of your ten fruit up your butt. If you make any noise, or cannot complete the task, than you will be beheaded.""

Anxious to be over with it, Chris went first. On the 7th berry, he let out a grunt, and the villagers beheaded him.

One day, Bozo was setting up for a little boys party when the birthday boy asked him to do some magic. Bozo says, ""Listen kid, I honk my horn and make balloon animals, that's all I do."" The boy seemed satisfied and walked off.

The party soon starts getting in full swing, some little boys friends running around the big yard, while others are watching Bozo make balloon animals. In the middle of making a giraffe, the birthday boy asks Bozo to do a magic trick. Bozo, who is a little irritated at the repeated question, calms himself before saying, ""Listen kid, I honk my horn and make balloon animals, that's all I do."" The boy is obviously disappointed and walks back to the boys playing in the yard. 

After the birthday boy opened up his presents, he tried his luck again with Bozo, who was taking a break while the kids were distracted. The birthday boy goes up to Bozo and asks him to do a magic trick. Bozo is now extremely annoyed, decides to shut up the boy. ""Ok kid, you got me. If you want to see a magic trick, meet me in your hallway closet in 15 minutes with your pants around your ankles and bent down."" The birthday boy was ecstatic, and ran to the hallway closet to fulfill the request.

15 minutes later Bozo comes into the hallway closet to see the little boy and says, ""For my magic trick, I will stick my thumb up your ass!"" The little boy proceeds to hear a grunt and feel something up there. 

Bozo shakes his hands in front of the little boy and says, ""Look, MAGIC!!!""",NSFW

"I'm a shovel. I'm a shovel. I've been with the same family for over 25 years. The mother usually puts me to use for gardening purposes. I dig a hole for seeds to be planted. Watermelon seeds, tomato seeds, pumpkin seeds, carrot seeds, cabbage seeds, you name it. 

The dad uses me for burying small pets once every few years. I dig holes to bury mice, rats, hamsters, dwarf hamsters, you name it. 

Sometimes he uses me to work on the plumbing below the dirt. I dig holes to access sewage pipes, water pipes, maybe to clear the area for new pipes, or to replace older pipes. You name it. 

Their son really likes the idea of leaving valuables buried underground for his own future family to find, or maybe for a different family who may live in this house one day. He buries toys, money, video games, movies, candies, you name it. 

Their dog thinks i'm a toy. He always grabs a hold of me, and hides me somewhere on the property. In a bedroom, under a couch, under a chair, in a kennel, in the bathroom, somewhere in the backyard, you name it. 

But i'm an old shovel. 25 years for this family. My edges have gone blunt. I'm rusty, and dirty. My handle hurts to hold. The family has bought plenty of other gardening utensils. Axes, pitchforks, shears, you name it. 

They even bought items that can sharpen up those utensils, make them seem like they're brand new. But I'm far too old for that. The rust has run deep. I might shatter with the slightest touch nowadays.

The next day, he called her up and asked her to go dancing. She agreed. As they talked, he jokingly asked her what her favorite flower was. Realizing his intentions, she told him that he shouldn't bring her flowers -- if he wanted to bring her a gift, well, he should bring her a Swiss Army knife!

The bike is a little older but it is in perfect condition, no scrapes or dents, the chrome pieces shine like new, and the leather seat looks like it hasn‚Äôt aged a day. He is stoked!!

STILL NOTHING! No one says a thing, so after a couple minutes he looks at the mom who is also very beautiful and looking good and starts making out with her and groping her, still nothing! ‚ÄúUnbelievable‚Äù he thinks! So he starts fucking the mom right there at the dinner table. His girlfriend and her dad act as though nothing is happening even though they obviously see everything, they are silent...

"Pakis! The Pope was on a visit to England, and taking a tour of Newquay.

Walking along the seafront, he noticed something strange going on in the sea a few hundred metres from the beach. A Pakistani man who looked badly hurt seemed to be drowning in the water. The pope asked his aid if he could borrow some binoculars so that he could see what was happening more clearly. Looking through them, he then realised that the Pakistani man was in fact being attacked by a shark.
30 seconds later, a speedboat came into view with three men on board, all wearing England football shirts. The first man harpooned the shark, while the second guy saved the Pakistani by pulling him onto the boat. The third guy and the first guy then struggled with the shark, eventually killing it before pulling it's dead body onto the boat before speeding off to the harbor where they hung the shark up on public display, to cheers from the large crowd that had formed nearby.

The Pope, still in a state of disbelief, insisted on meeting the three men, and headed to the harbour. On arrival, he called them over to him and said: ""What I have just witnessed was truely amazing. I'd heard there was a lot of racial tension in England, but your actions and bravery have showed me that this is indeed not the case. You all risked your life to save this man and I hope that news of this will travel around the world and set an example to others. May you all live in peace and harmony forever, and may God bless you for the rest of your lives.""
He then returned to his car and was driven off back into the town.

The first English guy turned around to the second guy and asked ""Who the hell was that?""

""That was his Holiness the Pope."" Replied the second guy.

""Well he knows FUCK ALL about shark fishing!"" added the third guy. ""How's the bait doing or do we need to find another one?""",NSFW

When they reached the pearly gates of heaven, they were greeted by Saint Peter himself.

He greeted them and explained, ‚ÄúBefore I let you pass into Heaven, I must ask if any of you have ever strayed from the path, and used a part of your body in a sexual way? As you know, you must be pure to cross into Heaven!‚Äù

They all shook their heads at him, as if even the suggestion of this was absurd.

He continued, ‚ÄúIf you have, you must wash the unholy part of your body at this font, so as to cleanse it, otherwise you shall not pass into Heaven and will go straight down to Hell.‚Äù 

Saint Peter pointed to a golden font, which stood proudly in front of the gates of Heaven.

Again, the nuns all shook their heads at this preposterous suggestion.

‚ÄúVery well then ladies, if you would be so kind as to join the queue, we will have you enter into Gods kingdom shortly.‚Äù He turned and headed down to the gates to continue his duty of administering people into Heaven.

And so the three nuns joined the back of the queue. 

As they were getting closer to the gates, the first nun slyly dipped her hand into the font and quickly washed it with the holy water.

She reached the front of the queue and warily stepped over the threshold.

‚ÄúLo and behold, you are pure!‚Äù Cried Saint Peter, and the first nun gleamed with joy as she was accepted into heaven.

Suddenly, the third nun pushed in front of the second nun and started gargling the holy water from the font!

"So, the time had come to break up with my girlfriend Don't get me wrong, there was definitely fault on both sides.  But she could never confront our issues head-on; whenever we came up to a difficult topic (e.g., lying, trust, infidelity) she would always try to distract me and change the subject.    
This tendency extended to when it had come time to end the relationship.  Every time I got close to saying that I thought it was time for a break, or I couldn't do this any longer, she would suddenly remember something she had to do, something else we needed to deal with - or, better yet, something she'd picked up.    
  To provide a little background: in the over 5 years of our relationship, she had come to know my preferences and passions quite well.  One of my greatest weaknesses is for specialty dried fruits.  Just when things were at their worst, apricots rolled in cinnamon or plums soaked in exquisite liqueurs and sun-dried would appear on our apartment's lone table out of thin air.  Though I could never quite find out where it was located, she frequently ordered from some shop that dried and prepared grapes in the most incredible blends of spices and sweet flavorings I have ever tasted.    
Even after I was completed decided on terminating things, it took me another two years before we were really done.  As to why I didn't leave sooner, well, I had my raisins.    ",NSFW

Every year a goat race takes place in the month of august . My neighbour who is 66 years old has been part of the race for about 11 years and has never won. This year he was confident ,he had placed a bet with almost everyone in the village that he would win.
On the day of the race his goat was a bit too aggressive. And was ramming into anything in sight . When the race began his goat ran faster than any goat in the history of the race .
Everyone wondered how did this happen ? What was his secret
'Opium' I asked 
""No...too costly"" he replied with no expression 
""Then what""
""Chilli""
""Chilli? How"" I asked
""Rubbed some in his ass"" he replied with a smart look
Things did not go in his favour though ...
After the race the goat didn't stop so he had to rub some in his ass go sprint as fast as the goat",NSFW

"A trick joke to bitch slap somebody [long joke] For a friend you want to bitch slap or anybody for this matter. Front hand or backhand, it's your preference. You tell them if they want to hear a joke or if they have yet to hear it, the joke about a pimp and his THREE hoes. So it goes like this:

So their was a pimp walking down a block that he had THREE hoes working on. The THREE hoes were spread apart on the block. Each one of the THREE hoes had a corner of her own.

The pimp walks up to the first hoe and says ""where's my 150 dollars?"". The hoe then says ""150? I only owe you 125 dollars"". The pimp then slaps her and tells her ""bitch! Don't correct me."" The hoe then gives the pimp all the money that she's made.

The pimp now finds his way to his 2nd hoe and says ""where's my 175$?"". The hoe says ""175? I only owe you 150"". The pimp slaps the second hoe and tells her like he did the first ""bitch! Don't correct me."" He takes the money and moves on. 

So now the pimp is at his THIRD hoe and yet again, demands his money. He tells the THIRD hoe ""where's my 200 dollars?"" The hoe says ""200$? I only owe you 175."" Once again just like the others, he slaps his THIRD hoe and says ""bitch! Don't correct me"". Collects his money and keeps it moving.

So now the pimp finds his way to his 4th hoe......


Now if and when the person your telling the joke to says some thing like ""but wait. I thought you said he only had 3 hoes"" then this is where you slap the taste out of their mouth and tell them ""bitch! Don't correct me""",NSFW

""Yeah, that's the one,"" Henry says. ""I, uh, asked her out on a date and she said yes."" 

Jim nearly chokes on his beer and slaps Henry's back. ""Attaboy! I didn't know you had it in you. If she's as perfect as you say she is then you're the luckiest dog I've ever met. So what's the problem?""

Henry looks around the bar and leans in. ""That's exactly the problem. She's too attractive. This is embarrassing, but whenever she comes into my office I have to stay behind my desk. I get an instant erection, every time.""

Jim tries to swallow his laughter but sees in Henry's eyes that he means every word. ""I'm serious,"" Henry continues. ""How the hell am I supposed to go on a date with this woman if I'm at full mast the whole time?"" 

Jim leans back on his barstool and takes a swig of beer. ""Easy, before you go on the date, tape your dick to the inside of the leg. She'll never notice and you won't make a jackass of yourself."" 

Henry glares at him but slowly realizes it might be the only solution he has. ""To hell with it! I'm gonna do it!"" 

Date night comes and goes and the next day Jim finds Henry back at the bar with a half dozen empty beer bottles scattered in front of him. ""So...the date. You did remember to tape it down, didn't you?""

""Yeah I remembered,"" Henry said, still looking down. ""I taped it down before I went over, and when I got to her house she opened the door wearing nothing but a skimpy little robe. She pulled me through the door and slid the robe off. Right then and there."" Henry sighs and takes a chug of his beer. 

""That is the most incredible thing I ever heard,"" Jim says. ""So she was naked from the moment you got to her house?""

""Yep."" Henry sighs and motions for another beer. 

Jim shakes his head. ""You got to see the woman of your dreams naked, so what the hell is your problem today?""

""I kicked her in the face.""

""Thank you, but I am old man and need to pull over many times for toilet while driving, and I am not sure what to do if the car brakes down even more while towing."" The guy was puzzled but got an idea. ""Well I will be watching you from the mirrors. If you need to go to the toilet, use the left blinker. If there is something wrong with the car, just use the right one.""

The old man agreed and off they went. After a while a Porsche passed them very fast. Having the Ferrari the guy got furious and without thinking floored it ans started to chase the Porsche while towing the old man and Lada behind. At the same time, the old man started to grow an urgent need for a toilet stop, so he put on the blinker to the left. The guy driving the Ferrari did not notice this and kept on pressing for the Porsche.

"When four of Santa's elves got sick and the trainee elves didn't produce the toys as fast as the regular ones, Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule‚Ä¶ Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit.

This stressed Santa even more.

When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where.

More stress.

Then, when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.

Frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum.

When he went to the cupboard, he discovered that the elves had hidden the liquor and there was nothing to drink.

In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor.

He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw end of the broom.

Just then, the doorbell rang and an irritable Santa trudged to the door.

He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.

The angel said, very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas, Santa! Isn't it a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?""

And so began the tradition of the little angel on top of the Christmas tree‚Ä¶",NSFW

The king, however, being a wealthy and loved ruler, had a hut that was a magnificent two stories high.


Every year on his name day the king would decide that he wanted a new throne and demanded all the best craftsman make him a grand throne as a birthday present.


He would then pick his favorite and, being greedy, would also keep his old throne and all the other runners up and put them on his 2nd floor.


Well eventually, after putting all the various seats up there, the time came when the 2nd floor of his hut gave out and dozens of thrones came crashing down upon the king, killing him instantly.

"A cab driver picks up a Nun in New York... There is this taxi driver in New York City nearing the end of his shift, but he decides that he will pick up one more person before he turns in for the night, so he stops and pulls over and a nun gets in the car. She tells him where to go and they start off. It is a long drive and the driver keeps looking at the nun through the rear view mirror of his cab. 

Now, the nun is getting very upset by this and says, ""Um...can I help you??!!""

The taxi driver looks very embarrassed and says, ""I'm sorry, it's very embarrassing, I cannot say.""

And the nun looks at him and says, ""Now, my son, I have been in this business far too long to be disturbed by anything you have to say, so go ahead.""

The driver thinks for a minute and says, ""Ok, well, for as long as I can remember, I have had the biggest fantasy about kissing a nun.""

She looks amused at first then replies, ""Well, I think I can help you with that, but first you must promise me two things, the first is that you are a Catholic, the second is that you are single. If you can promise this, I shall give you what you ask for.""

And the driver says, ""Great!! Sure I'm a single Catholic!!""

So they pull into an alley and the nun crawls into the front seat of the cab and gives the driver an amazing kiss. The type of kiss where time feels like it stops almost. And they finish up and get back on the road. 

Soon the taxi driver starts looking nervous and peering at the nun in the rear view mirror again. Just staring at her, and when the nun asks him why he is staring and he says, ""Well, I'm afraid I haven't been completely honest with you. You see, I'm not a catholic, and I'm also married.""

The nun smiles and says, ""Well, I haven't been honest with you either...My name is Kevin, and I'm going to a Halloween party.""",NSFW

Finally, after waiting for over an hour, he gets fitted and pays for the rental. Relieved, he heads to the florist for a corsage, only to discover that the line there is also out the door, and halfway around the block, to boot!

"Fred Rogers, Richard Dawkins and the Buddha walk into a bar Fred Rogers, Richard Dawkins and the Buddha walk into a bar. They order an unlimited amount of beer. The server says ""No, we don't really have room for them here, but give them the beers and ask if this bar's bar."" We find ourselves at ""The Cave"", a cave in Ohio that the monks used for meditation during medieval times. The monks lived there for years to cleanse themselves from the diseases of the day. What's more, they spent all day drinking and eating, going to the mountains to explore the earth and so forth, in order to get a better experience when they went back to their rooms. But once the next day they heard that the beer was gone, so they took a few breaks and returned to the caves where the monks had been. As mentioned before, this was centuries before we were told to drink beer, and before we had beer cans back then.
So to answer the question, how much beer did the monks drink during this cave visit? The answer is absolutely nothing. One has to take out a straw and drag it across the floor to get a drink. I am told that this is exactly when they are talking about what they like, and not actually where these beers were brewed. And even then, one has to take some distance from the cave to see it.

"The White Ape A man was driving down the road in the middle of the night when, naturally, his car broke down. There was no one around, but he saw a light up ahead. He walked towards it and soon figured out that it was a farmhouse.

The man knocked on the door, and a farmer answered. ""Sir,"" he said to the farmer, ""my car broke down on the road about a mile away, and I was wondering if I could use your phone.""

The farmer told the man that he didn't have a phone, but in the morning, he would drive him into town. He would give him a place to stay during the night, ""but you must promise that you won't touch the white ape.""

""The white ape?"" asked the man. ""What's the white ape?""

""Promise you won't touch it!""

""OK, OK, I won't!""

The farmer showed the man to his room, and the man went to bed.

But as the night wore on, the man couldn't get to sleep. He kept wondering, ""What in the world is the white ape? And why can't I touch it?""

The man couldn't get back to sleep, so he got up and went down to the kitchen to find some milk or something to help him creep to dreamland.

Upon arriving at the bottom of the stairs, he found that the old farmer was sitting in the kitchen, also apparently not able to sleep.

""Sir,"" said the man, ""I've been tossing and turning all night--I just want to know: What *is* the white ape?""

The farmer sighed and said, ""Come on. I'll show him to you. But you *can't* touch him.""

The man agreed.

The farmer led him outside, to the backyard. They went through eight cement doors, each one thicker than the last. Finally, they came to a huge room with a gigantic cage sitting in the middle of it. In the cage was a tremendously large white ape, snoring away.

""Ahhhhh ..."" said the man. ""Now I understand.""

The two went inside.

And yet, the man was not satisfied. He lay in bed thinking, ""That was the white ape ... but why can't I touch it? Just one, tiny touch can't hurt ... can it?""

So he climbed out of bed, stealthily made his way down the stairs, sneaked out the back door, continued through the gate, and crept to the side of the cage where the ape was sleeping. Slowly, quietly, he reached his hand through the bars and touched the ape ...

Its humongous eyes immediately jerked open. It roared.

Frightened, the man backed up, nearly tripping over himself.

The ape jumped to its feet, shook the cage doors, and broke them easily. Panicked, the man turned around and ran for his life.

The ape came after him, breaking the cement walls as he came. Faster, and faster, he was gaining on the man.

The man spotted the old farmer's truck. He jumped in, spotted the keys on the seat, threw them in the ignition, and revved the engine to life. He peeled out of the driveway as quickly as he could, but the ape didn't relent. It continued after him.

Faster and faster, he pressed on the accelerator, but he couldn't outrun the ape--it was gaining on him. Finally, the man lost control of the truck and ran it into the ditch.

The ape ran up to the car, roared, and ripped the door off the vehicle. It reached inside, slapped the man on the arm and screamed, ""TAG!!! YOU'RE IT!!!""",NSFW

"Tequila Bets A man walks into a bar, notices a very large jar on the counter, and sees that it's filled to the brim with $10 notes. 
He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it. He approaches the bartender and asks, 
""What's with the money in the jar?""
""Well.., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Maserati."" 
The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, ""What are the three tests?""
""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""

So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the jar. 
""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do: 

First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't make a face while doing it

""Second -
There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth.  You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""

""Third -
There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem.""

The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 -- but I'm not an idiot!
I won't do it!  You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila
and then do all those other things!""

""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is.""

As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says,
""Where's the damn tequila?!""

He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can.
Tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn‚Äôt make a face -- and he drinks 
it in 58 seconds!
Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole.

The boss doesn't believe them but lets them off with it just because he let the first guy get away with it.

"This horse is sitting at home one day watching MTV... He's watching a heavy metal music video, and the guitarist plays an amazing solo. The horse says ""that looks amazing, I want to do that!""

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

So the horse walks into a bar.

"A Health and Safety Christmas Message Please be advised that all employees planning to dash though the snow in a one-horse open sleigh, going over the fields and laughing all the way are required to undergo a Risk Assessment addressing the safety of open sleighs. This assessment must also consider whether it is appropriate to use only one horse for such a venture, particularly where there are multiple passengers.

Please note that permission must also be obtained in writing from landowners before their fields may be entered.

To avoid offending those not participating in celebrations, we request that laughter is moderate only and not loud enough to be considered a noise nuisance.

Benches, stools and orthopaedic chairs are now available for collection by any shepherds planning or required to watch their flocks by night.

While provision has also been made for remote monitoring of flocks by CCTV cameras from a centrally heated shepherd observation hut, all facility users are reminded that an emergency response plan must be submitted to account for known risks to the flocks.

The angel of the Lord is additionally reminded that prior to shining his/her glory all around he/she must confirm that all shepherds are wearing appropriate personal protective equipment to account for harmful effects of UVA, UVB and the over-whelming effects of glory.

Following last year's well publicised case, everyone is advised that EC legislation prohibits any comment with regard to the redness of any part of Mr R Reindeer. Further to this, exclusion on Mr R Reindeer from reindeer games will be considered discriminatory and disciplinary action will be taken against those found guilty of this offense.

"A man, his dog, and a sheep A man washed up on a beach after a shipwreck. Only a sheep and a sheepdog were washed-up with him. After looking around, he realized that they were stranded on a deserted island.


After being there awhile, he got into the habit of taking his two animal companions to the beach every evening to watch the sunset. One particular evening, the sky was a fiery red with beautiful cirrus clouds, the breeze was warm and gentle - a perfect night for romance.

As they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better to the lonely man. Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his arm around it. The sheepdog, ever-protective of the sheep, growled fiercely until the man took his arm from around the sheep.

After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling. A few weeks passed-by and, lo and behold, there was another shipwreck.

The only survivor was Hillary Clinton.

"All Elephant's look the same If this doesn't bring a tear to your eyes you must have a heart made of stone. ""In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University.
On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephant's foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.
The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually, the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.
Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.
Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter's legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.
Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant",NSFW

"Pancho Villa So a man walks into a bar in Mexico and sees a picture of Pancho Villa hanging on the wall.  He starts talking to a local bar fly and it turns out this man‚Äôs uncle had once met Pancho Villa!

‚ÄúOnce, when my uncle was a young boy, Pancho Villa came riding through his town.  My uncle, who was young and stupid at the time, ran up to Pancho Villa and stopped his horse.  The horse reared  causing Pancho‚Äôs pistol to fly out of its holster and on to the ground right next to my uncle.

My uncle, who was still young and stupid, picked up the gun and immediately aimed it at Pancho Villa.

‚ÄòGet off your horse,‚Äô he barked, half-jokingly.

Pancho weighed the situation and realized he didn‚Äôt have much of a choice, so he climbed down off of his horse.

‚ÄòGet on the ground,‚Äô my uncle ordered.

Pancho very reluctantly dropped to his knees and lie on the ground.

‚ÄòEat that pile of horse shit right there.‚Äô

Pancho Villa scanned around, but his men were no where in sight.  He had no choice but to grudge it out and take a bite of the horse‚Äôs shit that lie there in front of him.

When Pancho Villa ate the shit, my uncle lost it.  He started laughing so hard that he couldn‚Äôt contain himself and Pancho saw his opportunity.  He lunged at my uncle and ripped his gun back from his hand.

Just then, Pancho‚Äôs men rode up.  They almost killed my uncle right there on the spot, but Pancho Villa stopped them.

‚ÄòYou may live another day boy, but you must do one thing first.  Eat that pile of horse shit right there.‚Äô

My uncle had no choice but to choke down the entire pile of horse shit as Pancho Villa and his soldiers looked on.  When he was finished, they rode off out of town.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow! What an amazing story!‚Äù the traveler said. ‚ÄúBut you really can‚Äôt expect me to believe that, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe me?  My uncle still lives just outside of town.  You can ask him for yourself!‚Äù

So the two men walked down to the uncle‚Äôs farm.  When they arrive, they see an old man sitting on the porch.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey there uncle. This man here has a question for you.‚Äù

During his exploring he manages to find an odd looking building. *This looks interesting,* he thinks, so he enters. There he is suddenly approached by an old man, who asks what he's doing here?

""Oh?"" says the man. ""I just want to know what this poky little place is for.""

""Actually,"" says the old man, ""you've come at a good time. This is a commune holding a small religious community and we're looking to grow our numbers.""

""I'm afraid I'm not interested.""

""Well, perhaps you can stay until night and see what it's like,"" the old man suggests.""

Now the tourists is suspicious that this old man might have criminal purposes, and considers leaving. But as soon as the thought enters his mind, he remembers his commitment to truly experience Southeast Asian culture, off the beaten path, more immersed than other tourists. *I'm not afraid of a little risk,* the tourist thinks to himself. 

""I think I will stay for a while,"" the tourist says, to the old man's happiness. The old man, after saying some words of thanks, leads the tourist to a table.

""Let me tell you about our little commune,"" says the old man. ""You see, we that originally had our roots in America. We're taking it upon ourselves to bring Jesus' millennial kingdom ourselves. Other Christians are all deluded. You see, Jesus really returned during..."" 

And the old man continues on like this, and the tourist begins to grow bored. Sensing this, the old man suddenly changes topic. 

""Young man,"" he says, ""let me tell you something special about our religious commune. We don't believe in marriage. We're freer than that. We let men and women sleep with whomever they please.""

""Some sort of prostitution thing?""

""Oh heavens no, we don't believe in money. Everything is a free choice.""

""Oh really?"" asks the tourist, who is starting to think that his risk-taking will pay dividends. ""Can I see some of the others, then?""

""Of course!"" says the old man, and he calls out some names. In a short while three beautiful women appear at the end of the room. 

""Oh my,"" says the tourist.

""Indeed,"" says the old man, ""we don't believe in marriage. Ladies, please escort this young man to the guest room.""

And the women, giggling, surround the tourist and take him upstairs toward a large room with a bed in the middle. Hardly believing his luck, the tourist quickly strips down. But then the women start to laugh.

""Oh, wait, you don't understand!"" cries the tourist. ""It's just cold in here!"" But the women are laughing harder now.

""Whatever!"" cries the tourist, ""you probably all have nasty STDs anyway!"" He quickly pulls his pants back up over his incredibly embarrassing erection. Tears appear in his eyes. The women are in hysterics. Humiliated, the tourist runs out of the room, downstairs, past the old man, and out the door, harshly regretting his decision to go off the beaten path.

""Well,"" chuckles the old man to himself. ""Looks like Oneida Bangkok makes a hard man humble.""

"One man's life mission A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.

Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""
The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""

The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task.

After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""

The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!
With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......

There was a boy that had a question about God. He goes to his local priest to see if he has an answer. The boy presents the question and the priest is completely at a loss of words. The question is so challenging that he could not give an answer. Unwilling to let the boy go unsatisfied without an answer, the priest takes the boy to a local bishop that knows even more about religion than the priest

The boy approaches the bishop and asks him the same question. Again, the bishop has no answer that will satisfy any of the parties. Seeing that the boy is getting discouraged that no one can answer the question the bishop sends the boy directly to the Vatican to talk to the pope. 

This pope was very popular among the people. And he knew everything. He was so smart they called him Pope The Wise. The boy walks up to the pope and asks him the question. The pope begins to answer but then gets choked up and realized that not even he has the answer for the question. 

As all hope was just about to be lost, an old nun walks into the room. The nun asks the boy to ask her this famous question and the boy does. The nun formulates the most perfect answer to the boys question. Almost everyone rejoices and all is good.

As he passed the next exit he noticed a billboard proclaiming ""Peaches of ALL flavors 2 miles"". He dismissed the sign knowing peaches only tasted like peaches and kept driving. A couple miles later he see the same sign again twice as big proclaiming ""Peaches of All flavors next right"". Since as he liked peaches and was hungry he eased the rig into the turning lane to find some peaches. As he pulled into the produce stand  he encountered an old man with a frumpy fruit shack and a sign proclaiming his many flavored peaches.

The old man rummaged around for a few seconds and produced a slightly off looking peach proudly and handed it to the truck driver. He bit into it and sure enough it tasted like an apple, dumbfounded he asked ""well do you have one that tastes like orange?"". The old man rolled his eyes and said ""turn it around"" twirling one finger in a circular motion. Sure as rain the driver bit the other side of the peach and it tasted like an orange. Aghast at what he had found he asked the old man for something less likely ""Sir, i'd like a peach that tastes like grapes"", again the old man dug out a peach that tasted like grapes, astounded the driver asked for watermelon flavored peaches and again the old man twirled his finger, watermelon was in the other side. Slightly aggravated at this point knowing the improbability of what he was experiencing he suddenly had an idea for a flavor the old man couldn't possibly have. ""Sir, it seems you really do have peaches of all flavors, but i must ask, do you have one that tastes like pussy?!?"" The old man smiled and said "" I knew you'd ask, they allways do, and yes of course i have a pussy flavored peach"". The old man rummaged around in a particularly dusty box of peaches and again handed the driver another peach. Eager for the long forgotten taste the driver eagerly shoved the peach in his mouth and instantly began spitting and sputtering, amid his hacking he proclaimed ""THAT TASTES LIKE SHIT"". The old man cackled and twirled his finger  again ""Silly boy, turn it arounddd...........""   ",NSFW

So he pulled out his shovel and killed 20 more while screaming like a banshee! Then the blade on his shovel broke, so he killed the rest with his bare hands.""


 

The teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story. ""Well,"" Johnny replied, ""Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.""",NSFW

‚ÄúRabbi,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI noticed that you buy a lot of candles.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù answered the Rabbi.

‚ÄúWell, Rabbi, what do you do with the candle drippings?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúA good question,‚Äù noted the Rabbi. ‚ÄúWe actually save them up, and when we have enough we send them back to the candle maker. And every now and then, they send us a free box of candles.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù replied the auditor, somewhat disappointed that his unusual question actually had a practical answer.

So he thought he‚Äôd go on, in the traditional obnoxious way...

‚ÄúRabbi, what about all these cookie purchases? What do you do with the crumbs from the cookies?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, yes,‚Äù replied the Rabbi calmly, ‚Äúwe actually collect up all the crumbs from the cookies and when we have enough we send them in a box back to the manufacturer. Every now and then, they send a box of cookies.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù replied the auditor, thinking hard how to fluster the Rabbi.

‚ÄúWell, Rabbi,‚Äù he went on, ‚Äúwhat do you do with all the foreskins from the circumcisions?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, here too, we do not waste,‚Äù answered the Rabbi. ‚ÄúWhat we do is save up all the foreskins and when we have enough we actually send them to the IRS.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe IRS?‚Äù asked the auditor in disbelief.

There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‚ÄòNo, this is my first time.‚Äô

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‚ÄòJust a minute,‚Äô she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‚ÄòDo these excite you?‚Äô She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‚ÄòWell, come on‚Äô, she said, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt have much time.‚Äô So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

Last, ya gotta fuck Mary over there till she cums"" he concludes, gesturing to an absolutely ancient woman sitting in the corner.

The man shrugs. ""Well, that certainly doesn't seem like the thing for me."" he says, drinking his beer. As the night goes on, the alcohol helps build his courage.

So there's this guy, and he's got an ant farm, but not like a normal ant farm, it's like a regular farm that's run by ants, and one day the ant in charge of the farmer ants says to the guy 'hey guy, we're workin our thoraxes off tryin to harvest these crops but it's real tough, boss. See they're all the way up in the trees and we're super small, i think we need some bigger ants to help us get the job done.' 
So the guy's like 'shit i guess i did notice that production's been pretty minimal, i guess i could try to get you some bigger ants. Aren't most of you pretty much all the same size though?' 
And the ant's all 'yo that's racist.'
So they guy's like 'whoa whoa whoa i didn't mean it like that, just relatively in size to a tree. Look i'll go right now to get us some taller ants to help your team.'
So the guy goes to the unemployment center in town and asks around for some tall ants but they've all been hired by other farms that can offer health insurance. He tried to recruit some practice squad players in the ant basketball league but couldnt match their salaries. He even tried to convince an ant warden to give him his tallest ants in a prisoner work release program but the warden wanted a percentage of everything sold and one of the tall ant inmates spit on the guy while he was there, so he decided that wouldn't work either. 
He was walking down the street tired, frustrated, and desperate when he came across a super tall homeless ant holding a 'will work for food' sign. So the guys really excited thinking he's found his solution and explains to the hobo ant that his farmer ants aren't tall enough and the homeless ant starts laughing in his face. 
""Maaaaan you don't need bigger ants, you need smaller trees!"" Said the ant.
The guy was shocked at how simple and elegant the hobo ant's solution was, but also furious that he'd spent an entire day looking for tall ants. He decided he needed a drink to ease his mind so he stopped in the nearest bar. 
So the guy goes to the bartender, ""hey barkeep lemme get 4 shots of the strongest booze you got.""
And the bartender's like ""brother i've got some moonshine that'll melt your face off but it's crazy strong, you sure you want 4 shots?""
And the guy says, ""look man i've had a nightmare of a day, i know my limits, trust me i can handle my shit.""
So the bartender's like ""allright man if you insist"" and he lines up four shots of the moonshine and the guy wastes no time and throws em back, one after another, slams down the fourth shot glass, and then immediately projectile vomits all over the bar, including on the bartender.

"The camel leg thief Shaun is a tourist visiting a small town in the Arabian desert. He stops into a shop one day and when he's finished, he finds that his camel is missing its legs. Shocked, he approaches a bystander and asks if he saw who took his camel's legs. The bystander squints at him, looks at the camel, and says to Shaun ""ah, that would have been the Camel Leg Thief, you can find him that way"".

Shaun sets off in the direction the bystander pointed him in, he walks along desert roads, after an hour he comes across a traveller going in the opposite direction. He tells the traveller his story and asks how much further until he reaches the Camel Leg Thief. The traveller replies ""a long way along the desert, you will need a car"". Shaun walked back to the town, found a car rental branch, hired a car and set off again along the road.

He travels down the road until he reaches a huge lake. A sailor stands by his small rowing boat nearby. Shaun says ""I am looking for the Camel Leg Thief"". The sailor replies ""the Camel Leg Thief lives across the water, but you can rent a boat back in the town"". Running out of patience, Shaun drives back to the town, rents a boat, attaches it to the back of his car and goes back to the water. He gets in the boat and begins rowing across.

He rows for over an hour until he reaches the other side. On the other side is a mountain range. ""I am looking for the Camel Leg Thief"", Shaun tells a local. The local replies ""the Camel Leg Thief lives over the mountains, you can rent hiking gear back in the town"". Shaun is exasperated. ""For fucks sake!"", he exclaims. He gets back in the boat, rows across the water, gets in his car, and drives back to town. He finds a shop and rents hiking gear. He sets back off in the car, to the water, rows back to the mountain range and prepares his climb.

He begins hiking over the mountains, losing track of time as he crosses, and gets to the other side. There he is faced by desert plains, he asks a nomad, ""are you the Camel Leg Thief?"". The nomad tells him ""no, the Camel Leg Thief lives across these plains, but it will be dark soon and you can't cross the plains without warm clothing. There's a clothes shop in the town"". Shaun can't believe it. He hikes back across the mountains, rows across the water, drives back to the town, and finds the clothes shop. There, he buys warm clothing for night time.

He drives back to the water, rows across, hikes over the mountains, and gets to the plains. It is getting dark, so he pulls on the clothing and begins to walk the plains. He walks all night. As the sun rises, he sees a huge palace ahead of him. He enters through the large doors. Inside is a huge room, the grandest room you'll ever see. On a throne, sits a man. ""I am the Camel Leg Thief"", proclaims the man, ""what have you come for?"".

Shaun asks the Camel Leg Thief, ""did you steal my camel's legs?""

"Death? Or Bunga Bunga? Three missionaries were in a foreign land trying to convert the natives. 

One day as the missionaries were walking, they were taken hostage by the natives who then took them to their king. 

The King, on his throne of bone, looked at the three scared missionaries and after a long silence, the king asked the first missionary, 

""Death!? or Bunga Bunga?"" 

the first missionary looked around and worried and not knowing what ""bunga bunga"" was, he replied, ""Bunga Bunga"". 

10 natives then took him, strapped him to a tree, savagely raped the missionary, and sent him on his way. 

The king then looked at the second missionary and spoke, ""Death!? or Bunga Bunga?"" 

The missionary stood thinking, 

""I don't want to get raped... But I definitely am not ready to die"" 

he then answered the king, ""Bunga Bunga!"" 

Quickly he was grabbed, strapped to the tree and was savagely and forcefully raped by 20 natives. His ass was totally destroyed, but like the first, he was set free.

Finally the king addressed the last missionary, 

""Death!? or Bunga Bunga?"", 

the missionary thought, 

""I can't go through life after that type of abuse, There is just no way I could live with myself""

He boldly answered the king, ""I choose Death!""

For instance, if she is ovulating she is attracted to men with rugged and masculine features.     However, if she is menstruating, or menopausal, she is more prone to be attracted to a man with scissors lodged in his temple and a bat jammed up his butt while he is on fire.

‚ÄùExcuse me, mister,‚Äù he says, ‚Äùbut could you tell me how you managed to get such a magnificent member?‚Äù

‚ÄùSimple, man,‚Äù says the black guy. ‚ÄùWhen I was a boy, my mamma tied a brick to it and for a whole month I walked around like that.‚Äù

Bernie runs home and tells Sara, his wife. ‚ÄùSara,‚Äù he shouts,  ‚Äùcancel all visits and engagements. I‚Äôm not even going to work. I‚Äôm going to get myself a wonderful big prick!‚Äù

So Bernie ties a brick to his prick and does not go out of the house for a month.

Eventually, Sara says, ‚ÄùSo, let us take a look and see how it is growing.‚Äù

So Bernie opens his pants, takes a good look and says,
‚ÄùWell, we are halfway there, it has turned black already!‚Äù",NSFW

"The Aristrocrats (NSFW) A family walks into a talent agency. It's a father, mother, son, daughter and dog. The father says to the talent agent, ""We have a really amazing act. You should represent us.""

The agent says, ""Sorry, I don't represent family acts. They're a little too cute.""

The mother says, ""Sir, if you just see our act, we know you would want to represent us.""

The agent says, ""OK. OK. I'll take a look.""
So the father lights into a chorus of ""America the Beautiful"", while the son executes the daughter and the dog, gangland-style. After the first verse the mother reaches into the father's pants and pulls out his giant dick. The father's dick is huge beyond description. If you were traveling with that dick, the tip would be in the bar, making friends, before the balls crossed the county line. Anyhow, the mother fits this huge cock in her mouth, dislocating her jaw in the process, and begins to deepthroat the father, while the son drops his pants. He pulls out his tiny, stack-of-dimes dick, (maybe he'll one day be as big as his dad, fingers crossed) and begins to fuck his mother in the ass. At the final note of the song, the dad explodes with come, so much it begins to shoot out the mother's nose. The son pushes her forward onto his dad's cock, and because the cock fills her mouth and come fills her nose, she suffocates and dies. The father removes his dick and pulls out a pair of pliers. He begins pulling the mom's, excuse me, dead mom's teeth out of her head, and begins to skull fuck the toothless bitch, working the jaw back and forth. The son finishes his fuck in the mom's, excuse me, dead mom's ass, and pulls out his pocketknife. He flips his dead mom over and performs a C-section, reaching into her snatch and finding a fetus. He pulls out the fetus, and notices it feels like scrambled eggs, cause, well, it kind of is. He bites the unformed head off the fetus, and makes a disgusted face. He then runs out to the car. Meanwhile, the dad has shoved his huge cock down his dead wife's throat until he can feel it from the outside, and then pumps the throat around his cock, using it as a masturbation sleeve. The son runs back in with a George Foreman grill, heats it up, and prepares a marinade for his dead fetus sibling. He cooks it on high for 10 minutes, until golden brown, and adds fajita seasoning. As he enjoys a delicious snack, the father shoots another quart of come down the dead bitch's throat. The son tosses him the pocketknife (closed, for safety, of course) and puts the remains of the fetus on a spike that was conveniently placed in the corner, as the father begins to cut the dead mom's face off and the son fucks his dead sister in the exit wound he made with the pistol minutes before. As the son feels his balls tighten up, he turns to the father, now wearing his dead wife's face as a funny mask, and shoots his come across his dead mom's face. They strike poses and proclaim ""Taa Daa.""

For the longest time, the agent just sits in silence. Finally, he manages, ""That's a hell of an act. What do you call it?""

And the father says, ""The Aristocrats!""",NSFW

"Bear Warning The National Park Rangers are advising hikers in Glacier National Park and other Rocky Mountain parks to be alert for bears and take extra precautions to avoid an encounter.
They advise park visitors to wear little bells on their clothes so they make noise when hiking. The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.
Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.
It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat.
Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper.",NSFW

Amoxil is also called Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen.     The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra.

After careful consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin.

Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of course, Ibepokin.

Pfizer Corp. announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer..

It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one.

Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of ‚Äòcocktails‚Äô, ‚Äòhighballs‚Äô and just a good old-fashioned ‚Äòstiff drink‚Äô.

"A pretty blonde woman is driving down a country road in her new sports car when something goes wrong and it breaks down. Luckily, she happens
to be near a farmhouse.

She goes up to the farmhouse and knocks on the
door. When the farmer answers, she says to him,
""It's Sunday night and my car broke down! I don't
know what to do! Can I stay here for the night

""Well,"" drawls the farmer, ""you can stay here, but

standing behind the farmer. She judges them to be
in the early twenties. ""Okay,"" she says.

After they have gone to bed for the night the
woman begins to get a little horny just thinking
about the two boys in the room next to her. So she
quietly goes into their room and says,

""Boys, how would you like for me to teach you the
ways of the world?""

They say, ""Huh?""

She says, ""The only thing is, I don't want to get
pregnant, so you have to wear these rubbers.""

She puts them on the boys, and the three of them
go it all night long.

Forty years later, Jed and Luke are sitting on the
front porch, rocking back and forth.

Jed says, ""You remember that blonde woman that
came by here about forty years ago and showed us
the ways of the world?""

The third day, the same man approached the White House and spoke to the very same U.S. Marine, saying, ""I would like to go in and meet with President Trump.""

The Marine, understandably agitated at this point, looked at the man and said, ""Sir, this is the third day in a row you have been here asking to speak to Mr. Trump. I've told you already that Mr. Trump is no longer the president and no longer resides here. Don't you understand?""

It was only when he saw the yak charging toward him that he realized there was no way he was going to make it back to the safety of his vehicle.

The ensuing commotion combined spurts of running, valiant efforts to dodge the onrushing yak, and some serious wrestling. When the dust settled, the tourist was relieved to find himself sweaty and breathless but otherwise unharmed. However, his camera and lens had disappeared.

Looking up, he was dismayed to see his prized gear dangling from the yak's horns as he wondered how the fuck he was going to get it back.

The story has a happy ending: After some searching, the guide was able to find the yak herder who managed to retrieve the camera safely. :)",NSFW

Everyone made jokes about how he looked like an orange smurf with fake hair. He did not care. He liked the color orange bigly.  

One day he was attending a golf match and noticed a beautiful woman at the clubhouse. He cornered her, pressed his lips against hers, and touched her private parts without even saying hello.  She pushed him away screaming and he returned to his game of golf.  Later he noticed that his golf club seemed to feel a bit larger. Peering through his jack-o-lantern he noticed that his hands actually appeared to be a little smaller. He shrugged it off and continued on with the golf match.

A week later he was admiring his jack-o-lantern in the mirrored finish of an elevator while ascending a huge highrise. A different woman boarded the elevator and he thought ""I am a very powerful man, I am famous, I can do anything."" He tried to press his lips against hers, and grabber her private parts. She screamed and ran out of the elevator.

Later that evening as he shook hands with a business partner he noticed that his hand felt like it was being painfully crushed. He dashed into the bathroom and took off the jack-o-lantern and stared closely at his even smaller hands and screamed into the mirror, ""Oh my god. My hands are even smaller!!""

Each time he kissed or grabbed a woman without her permission his hands increasingly shrunk. Eventually he had no hands. His arms wore down to stubs so short that he could not even take off his jack-o-lantern anymore.

The media had been ignoring him for a while. He was not the star that he once was.  The media were now talking about many other people who made much more money than him, and about people who did good things for the poor and unhealthy. He became increasingly desperate for attention, and tossed and turned every night thinking, ""How could this be happening to me? Nobody talks about how rich and powerful I am anymore!"" ...

""And then what happened, dad??""

""He ran for president.""

"A cowboy's horse died on his way to town... As he was walking down the dusty trail, he happened across a ranch. With a renewed sense of hope, he asked the stable keeper if he had any horses for sale.

""Sorry, I've fallen on hard times myself. I had to sell all of my horses!""

The cowboy noticed a rather strange-looking steed standing right in the stable behind the keeper, a horse with matted, mangy fur, a deranged, glazed-over look in his eye and a stiff, motionless stance that would have made him look more like taxidermy than a living animal if it hadn't been for the occasional twitch.

""How much for that one?"" the cowboy asked.

The stable keeper shook his head. ""Trust me. You do NOT want that horse. I got him from a real shady-lookin' preacher one day. I don't know what that man did to him, but all's I know is that the horse ain't right. Never has been.""

The cowboy had his doubts, but he was desperate, and insisted on buying the horse despite the stable keeper's warnings. The keeper let him have the horse for free, as he couldn't bring himself to charge money for such a defective creature in good conscience. Before sending him on his way, the keeper gave the cowboy some instructions:

""As I said, this horse ain't right. He's completely unresponsive to everything except for two specific sentences. To make him go, you have to say 'Thank you Jesus!' To make him stop, you say 'Hallelujah!' In all honesty I can only hope the Lord is riding with 'ya tonight, 'cause otherwise... Well... Just be careful, okay?""

The cowboy excitedly hopped on his new horse, ready to ride off into town. Remembering what the old stable keeper told him, he shouted ""Thank you, Jesus!"" and instantly the horse went from standing to top speed in a second, nearly giving the cowboy whiplash!

Onward the horse galloped, smashing into fences and bushes that didn't slow it down for a second, dashing in a straight line even after missing its first turn a long time ago. It almost seemed a miracle that there were no trees directly in the way, because the horse would have surely ran into one.

The cowboy instantly regretted his decision, and in his panic he'd forgotten which phrase made the horse stop. Then, to his horror, he realized that the horse was heading full-speed off the edge of an incredibly steep cliff. The cowboy began frantically pulling on the reins, screaming all the religious phrases he could think of to try and halt the beast, but to no avail. Suddenly, when all hope seemed lost, he remembered at the last minute:

""HALLELUJAH!!!""

And instantly the horse froze, a single inch away from the edge of the cliff.

The cowboy was trembling and drenched in sweat. He had never been so close to certain doom. With a sigh of relief, he wiped his brow, looked up to the heavens and said:

""Thank you, Jesus!""",NSFW

""Then, if that don't work, you wait 10 seconds and then pull this emergency chute cord in the rear,"" he says, pointing to a smaller handle on the guy's shoulder.

""OK,"" says the guy, ""what if the chute still doesn't open?""

The instructor rolls his eyes (in his mind), and says, ""If the chute still doesn't open, just shout 'Buddha, Buddha, Buddha' and a giant hand will swoop out of the sky and release you safely on the ground.""

So the guy gets in the airplane, they reach jumping altitude, and away he jumps.

When it's time, he pulls the ripcord, and as luck would have it, his parachute doesn't open. He waits 10 seconds --more like panics for 10 seconds -- and pulls the emergency cord. The chute still doesn't open.

Cop - Dispatch, we have a grand theft auto. Please send backup

Driver - HEY OFFICER! I don't know what you think you're doing, but I assure you this is my vehicle, 100% bought and paid for!

Cop - Is that so? Tell me, what do you do for a living that you can afford to keep such a fine machine in such a state of disarray?

The Ferrari looks like a bad party the next morning, empty beer cans and booze bottles along side spent condoms and human filth

Driver - Well officer, not that its any of your FUCKING BUSINESS, but if you must know, I'm a stretcher.

Cop - Come again...?

Driver - People come to me and I start with one finger, then two, and eventually I have both of my hands DEEP inside their asshole.

Cop - ...

Driver - Then I start to stretch the asshole more and more until it's six feet wide.

Cop - And people PAY you for THIS?

"International relations The United Nations noticed that there was a lot of dissent among its ranks and relationships were strained. The UN leaders called a meeting and came up with a plan to increase morale that was discussed and agreed upon by all members. 

The plan was to take a representative from three different countries and place them on a deserted island for a year. They asked for volunteers. The representative from Greece stood up and shared how one of their own should be on the island because the Greeks are great at fishing and cooking seafood. Then the German delegate stood up and shared that Germans are great engineers and builders so they should be on the island to build the infrastructure. Finally the Japanese delegate stood and said they are great at moving goods and logistics so there should be someone from Japan on the island. 

The Greeks volunteered their finest chef who was in charge of all the food. The Germans their best engineer who was in charge of building and maintaing the habitat. The Japanese their top logistics person who was solely in charge of supplies. They were shipped to the island for a year with strict orders to work together. 

After the year was up the UN assembly sailed out to the island. They first saw a huge house that was meticulously built by the German. They were impressed. Welcoming them inside the home them was a large feast caught and cooked by the Greek. The Japanese representative, however, was nowhere to be found. When they asked the whereabouts of the Japanese representative the Greek and German said he took off into the jungle as soon as they arrived never to be heard from again. The UN immediately sent out a search team. The team was walking down a trail looking for the Japanese representative when all of a sudden he dropped down in front of them out of the tallest tree on the island and shouted ""SUPPLIES!""",NSFW

"A position for a bodyguard The most cruel of the chinese mafia leader hs recently lost in a gunfight his most trusted bodyguard, the man that carried out all of his orders, even the most evil tasks.

He decides to hire a new man for the job, and hundreds of machos, assassins, psychos, sadistic criminals apply. After several tests, hust 3 men are left as suitable character.

An american with a carrier in spec ops, a tragic story following a psychotic breakdown and several opened dossiers on the FBI desks, wanted in 67 countries and currently working in China as a killer.

An ex british spy, a traitor. Slender, precise, mannered and deadly as a poisoned dart. He travels the world even though every european state would give millions to the man that would find him and kill him. Not one that even tries, though.

A retired russian soldier, whose battle wounds left him covered with scars, almost deaf but trained him as the perfect killing machine, a one man army that doesn't even need orders to do the right thing: kill everything and everyone if asked.

""The final test"" the three are told ""is to enter this three rooms. Kill all the men in the first one, comb the mane of the lion in the second one, and rape the little girl in the last one""

The USA guy easily kills all the men in the first one suffering just a few minor cuts on an arm. After that he leaves the lion with a nice braided mane. But when it come to the little girl to rape, he refuses and goes away.

The brit manages to talk the guy in the first room into committing suicide. Then he proceeds to give the lion a shampoo. But again, when it comes to raping a child he snaps and goes away.

The russian guy enters the first room. Screams and grunts, then nothing more. After some the killing he exits with a horrible expression on his face ""boring job"" he says. He goes to the second room and after a few roar all that is heard is wailing sounds and a rythmic panting. Then he exit and says ""where is the little girl? I need a comb""",NSFW

Feeling awful, he brings it inside, washes and blow-dry's the rabbit to wait until dark and sneak it back into the his neighbor's back-yard rabbit cage. Success!

After two quiet weeks go by he sees the neighbor out in his front yard watering his flowers. ""Hiya neighbor! How ya doing?"". ""Well hello there! Good. Good thanks."" A few moments pass, and the man, riddled with guilt can't help himself but ask,""Say... how's that rabbit of yours?"". The neighbor replies, ""... it's funny about that rabbit... It died a month ago and I buried it, then two weeks ago I noticed it's back in that cage again!"".",SFW

"What if the Super Tuesday results were actual soups? Alabama ‚Ä¢ 53 delegates
The Democrats here elevated a classic cream of mushroom, picking mostly Hen of the Woods while the overwhelming majority of Republicans here insisted on drinking the Kool-Aid, even though the beverage is technically not a soup in any way.
Arkansas ‚Ä¢ 32 delegates
The Republicans were presented with a fountain of hot spring water, in which a small ham was placed. They were very proud of their ingenuity. A consom√© of edamame was most popular among the Democrats, however a few faithfully subsisted on some muscadines they tried to grow in office.
Alaska ‚Ä¢ 28 delegates
Republicans flip flopped around in a Shark Fin Soup but we have to wait until March 26th to know how the Democrats prefer their Ceviche.
Colorado ‚Ä¢ 66 delegates
All of the soup in Colorado is excellent, no jokes here. The Democrats were going to make the best decision and they did. By the time July rolls around, the Republicans‚Äô soup will old and smelly in the fridge and it will probably not be edible.
Georgia ‚Ä¢ 102 delegates
The Republican party had more ham but the FCC might be fining $1000 for failure to identify what animals they actually ate. The chickenhawk &amp; dumplings was the Democratic favorite.
Massachusetts ‚Ä¢ 91 delegates
Democrats came up with a neat idea to use razor clams in a New England chowder but they settled on a she-crab soup instead. Republicans gobbled the guk.
Minnesota ‚Ä¢ 77 delegates
In a refreshing change for Republican diners, Ajiaco was the crowd favorite while Democrats feasted on Lutefisk.
Oklahoma ‚Ä¢ 38 delegates
While the state is still searching for its signature soup, Republicans went with a prociutto-wrapped jelly donut. The bacon end got burnt, and the belly came up on top. For the Democrats, it was a Coffee Party USA, they swept in on a wind Dean Dozen of the plain, cake donuts- the best of the donuts.
Tennessee ‚Ä¢ 67 delegates
A coalition was formed to procure a spread of country hams for the Republicans. Diners preferred the taste of animals that were willing to be slaughtered. Sanders supporters got tired of soup too so they started pouring bourbon to accompany neglected goo goos clusters while the majority of the Democrats imagined a future of lame duck soup noodles in a blue bowl.
Texas ‚Ä¢ 222 delegates
Lunch pail democrats we‚Äôre not pleased with their party‚Äôs decision to go with Mrs. Grass as the golden nugget has been discontinued. Republicans opted for their shelf staple, Campbell‚Äôs Chunky Barbecue Seasoned Pork.
Vermont ‚Ä¢ 16 delegates
The grassroots vegetable soup stole the show on the Democratic menu here. In a Frankenfood alternative, Republicans opted for the Government cheddar cheese dip.
Virginia ‚Ä¢ 95 delegates
Democrats decided to start smoking, they thought it was more enjoyable than than eating too much. The Republican party obviously decided to split up a Virginia ham, but there was a hair in it. There you go again.",NSFW

He held the party around the pool in the backyard of his mansion.¬†Everyone was having a good time drinking, dancing, eating prawns and oysters from the barbecue, and flirting.

Then at the height of the party, the millionaire said, ""I have a 15 foot man-eating crocodile in my pool and I'll give a million dollars to anyone who'll join him in the pool.""

The words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash.

Everyone turned around and saw Brian in the pool fighting madly with the crocodile, jabbing it in the eyes with his thumbs, throwing punches, head butting it, getting it in choke holds, biting it's tail and flipping it through the air like some kind of martial arts expert.

The water was churning and splashing everywhere. Both Brian and the crocodile were screaming and raising hell.

Finally, after what seemed like an age, Brian strangled the crocodile and let it float to the top of the pool like a dead goldfish.

An exhausted Brian wearily climbed out of the pool with everybody staring at him in disbelief.

The millionaire said, ""Well, Brian, I reckon I owe you a million dollars then.""

""Nah, you all right boss, I don't want it,"" said Brian.

""No thanks, I don't want it,"" Brian insisted.

"Why you should always listen to an engineer (x-post from r/feghoot) &amp;#x200B;

Once upon a time, on the tropical island of Adiaster, a primitive tribe lived in a village of grass huts. There were no rival tribes on the island, no natural disasters to speak of, and no huge monsters that might emerge from the jungle in a primal rage to destroy the village. In general, life was good.

And life was about to get better! For on this particular day, a new king was ascending to the throne. Before his succession to the throne, the king had been a notorious party animal; he threw parties almost every day, and villagers flocked to his hut to participate. Ever the life of the party, the king had always been gracious host, and when his succession became imminent, villagers rejoiced at the prospect of such an amiable king.

But no kingdom is perfect, and this kingdom;s problem was classism (a problem many other kingdoms have had as well). Within this tribe, the hunters were at the top of the social hierarchy. They garnered glory and respect from their daring hunts, and were generally seen as the coolest kids on the block. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the builders and engineers of the tribe were considered the lowest class. They were often referred to as ""*nerds""* , an ancient Adiasterese term meaning ""those who bury their nose in books and diagrams all night long and have got no game"" (Adiasterese etymology is quite fascinating). As such, builders and engineers were often excluded from the kingdom's social events.

The king knew this. In fact, he had perpetuated this classism even before ascending to the throne. Even though he had never purposefully excluded engineers from his parties back in the day, nearly every attendant had been a hunter, creating an environment that would have made engineers feel incredibly uncomfortable if they showed up. The king resolved to bridge this gap between the classes of his tribe, and to do this, he promised to throw a lavish party on his coronation day. This was going to be a party for the ages: it was to be held in the palace, it was to last all night long, and everyone was invited.

This presented a problem, however. Although the palace was larger than any other hut in the village, it still wasn't large enough to hold everyone. The king decided to prepare for this by instructing his engineers to build a second floor to the palace, so that the entire tribe could party in his new house.

The head engineer was slightly nervous about the structural integrity of a hut with two stories, and he voiced those concerns to his future king. The king would not have it. ""This must be the party of a lifetime!"" he declared. ""This will bring our tribe closer together and usher in a new age of equality between hunters and engineers. You shall be in attendance as my guest of honor! You MUST build a second floor!"" When the head engineer remained uncertain, the king leaned into his head engineer's ear and whispered ""I heard there'd be *girls* at this party, too,"" and eventually the head engineer relented. The second floor to the palace was built.

This new palace was the talk of the town! Everyone thought it was the most impressive hut they had ever seen. But the king, though he would never admit it to anyone, was nervous about his coronation party. If the party wasn't *poppin'*(meaning ""a happy time for everyone involved"", usually associated with a public event that anyone can enter, as opposed to ""*lit""*, which usually carries the connotation of a more private event), it could fracture his kingdom for generations. To improve his chances of a *poppin'* party, the king called the head engineer into his chambers the night before the party and demanded that a disco ball be installed in the ceiling of the first floor.

The head engineer was flabbergasted. Not only was this incredibly short notice, but a heavy object putting pressure on the center of the building could result in the entire house collapsing. He argued with the king for hours, but the king remained undeterred. The next morning, mere minutes before the coronation began, the final touches on the disco ball were finished. The coronation itself went off without a hitch, the king was carried into his palace on his throne, and as the sun set, it was time to party.

The king had scheduled the party to begin as soon as night fell, and as soon as the sun had dipped below the horizon, the palace was flooded with people (which was highly unusual; In Adiasterese culture, it is customary to arrive to a party 45-60 minutes after the scheduled starting time). All the king's worries about his party faded immediately upon seeing the eager crowd; throngs of hunters, healers, fishermen, and even engineers had filed into his palace and having the time of their lives. Eventually, the head engineer arrived, and true to his word, the king loudly announced his guest of honor to a rowdy cheer. As the night wore on, the tribe seemed to grow closer. Hunters and engineers laughed together, drank together, and even played *pong* together (a traditional Adiasterese game in which small rocks are thrown at jugs of fermented fruit). Everything was going according to plan.

In the middle of the night, as the party continued, the king noticed that many of the partygoers had spilled drinks all over his throne. Ordinarily, this would have resulted in capital punishment; the throne had been passed down through generations of royalty and was sacred to the inhabitants of the village. But the king knew that now was not the time for punishment. It was a party! Getting all serious and traditional now could ruin the unity that he had worked so hard to foster. In order to save his throne from more desecration, he ordered several hunters to carry it upstairs, where no drinks were being served.

The head engineer, upon seeing this, yelled at the king to stop. He knew that if an object as heavy as the royal throne was brought onto the second floor of the house, the whole building would collapse. Unfortunately, the king was enjoying the party too much to be concerned with the head engineer's worries. ""Oh come on!"" he roared, ""enjoy the party! You've done enough worrying for a lifetime. Have some fun!""

But the king should have heeded his engineer's warning. For at that moment, as the throne was placed on the second floor, the hut collapsed. The party dissolved as the surviving tribespeople fled the scene. When the king came to, nearly half of his tribe had died, including his head engineer.

\~

Ten years later, the king still ruled his tribe. He still threw parties every day, in his rebuilt palace, and as always everyone was invited. But he still remembered that day that he lost half his tribe and one of his closest friends. To anyone who would listen, he would repeat the valuable lessons he learned that day:

Upon arriving at the pyramid, they are immediately told to leave as the site has already been excavated. The friends, not willing to concede, look for a different way in and find an entrance never before used.


It is through this entrance that they find a secret passage way, one that is made at first to look like a dead end but is truly a turn in the hallway. They venture around this turn and into a great room.


In this room are torches. A sign just inside the room warns ""He who lights this shall burn to death."" (In Egyptian hieroglyphs of course) The first friend takes a torch, and lights the end. The Friends venture through the room to another.


In this second room is a small lake, with a small canoe able to seat three. In the canoe is a paddle that reads, ""He who uses this shall die a watery death."" The second friend takes this paddle and uses it to guide the three of them to the other side of the lake and through a third and final door.


In this last room is a great atrium, filled with heaps upon heaps of golden artifacts and jewels. The three friends rush in, and come to a golden sarcophagus. The third friend looks at it, and sees that it has the warning ""The first man to touch this treasure shall die a most terrible death"" written on its exterior. The third friend, giving the message no care, proceeds to pick up as much gold as he can. His friends quickly follow suit.


Many months later, after the friends had returned home with their loot and used it to live lucrative lives, the third friend received troubling news. The first friend had been sleeping when his mansion had caught fire and burned to the ground, killing him. Remembering the warning, he calls the second friend, but they both laugh it off.


A month later, the third friend is watching the news when a breaking story comes on. It is his second friend, who had been out on his yacht. The boat had unexplainably capsized, killing him. The third friend saw this and grew terribly fearful.


Assuming he had a month left before whatever horror would befall him, the third friend sold many of his belongings to afford the most secure underground bunker. He then used his remaining fortune to buy an incredibly high tech security system, cameras all over, and 30+ armed guards stationed at the entrance.

The third friend spent a month in the bunker. 30 days passed, and night was falling when the third friend look to the security cameras. Outside of the bunker, at the entrance, was an empty expanse of land, save one object. All the security guards were mysteriously gone, and just in frame was the silhouette of a sarcophagus. The third friend panicked. 


Rushing to the door, he pushed all manners of furniture before it. A fridge, a bookshelf, his bed, a desk. But once he had placed the final barricade, a great pounding game to the door. Looking to security footage, the sarcophagus had begun to float, and was using itself as a battering ram. To the third friends horror, the door began to crack.


With a tremendous boom, the door and all the furniture was blasted away. The third friend screamed, as there in the doorway floated the sarcophagus. He ran through the bunker, stalked by the sarcophagus. The friend jumped into the bathroom and locked the door behind him. There, he sat on the toilet and cried.


***BOOM!*** The sarcophagus was there, breaking through the bathroom door. The third friend panicked, running to the sink as the sarcophagus inched forward. The friend picked up a bottle of shampoo and through it. The sarcophagus kept coming. He threw a can of shaving cream. The sarcophagus was within 10 feet of him now. He threw a tube of toothpaste. The sarcophagus was within arms length. The friend made one final attempt, he reached into the cabinet, grabbed a plastic bottle, filled with a green liquid , and threw it. The sarcophagus fell to the ground and turned to dust.


The man marveled at this. Looking for the last thing he had thrown, he picked it up and thought, ""All I had to do was take some NyQuil and the coffin would stop.""",NSFW

"This is a long one. What have I done.... So this nun goes into a bar and there are a bunch of squids and piranhas squabbling over their most recent MMA (mixed martial arts) tournament at the Alpha Squid's house the previous weekend. The piranhas were all like ""hey it's not a fair tournament! The cephalopods always got the advantage! We got good teeth but you can squirt ink and kick us with ya tentacles and stuff!""

And the squids are like ""no, no, no, it's totally fair. Piranhas got more agility and their teeth are just plain deadly, man"". The squids are real defensive of their MMA tourney.

And this nun (who walked into the bar before, remember-bet you didn't remember) speaks up and is like ""hey, why all the fighting? Why do you need an MMA tournament in the first place?""

But then the nun's robe and veil suddenly start talking out of nowhere. Nun's Habits have been known to come alive before, but are usually held back from doing this by a restrictive Papal proclamation put forth by Pope Francis last November-the Holy Habit Constrainment Order, PO #7462.5.


But this nun's robes come alive and stuff and they start taking to these squids and piranhas.

And suddenly things are starting to make sense and the nun's Habit is laying down some awesome new ground rules for the squids' and piranhas' mutual MMA tournaments. Things are looking good.

But then the robes and veil combo, amidst the nun standing around looking bored while her clothes did all the talking, made a suggestion to split up some of the allowed MMA moves per species. It said ""you know what, why don't we limit hand moves like punching and grabbing to the squids, and we'll let the piranhas take all the footwork and agility stuff, like kicks.""

A deathly silence suddenly fell over the room. The Habit said ""what? Did I say something wrong?"" The worried look on its face was reflected by glares from the squids and piranhas alike.

The Alpha Squid stood up on his two strongest legs and walked to the door of the bar. The other squids followed him to the door. The piranhas turned their faces away in fear. At this point the Habit is so confused as to what it said to offend these squids, just being a gentle robe and headpiece and all.

But just as the squids got to the exit, they all turned around, and threw their sunglasses on Squirtle Squad style. The Alpha Squid said, calmly but firmly:



""Silly Habit, kicks are for squids.""

When I got there he asked me what had happened and I told him everything and he asked me what the words were and when I told him he freaked out and expelled me.""

""Is that it? What on Earth were the words?"" his mother asked.

""Stark Sky,"" he said. 

His mom turned red and yelled at him to go up to his room and wait for his father. 

When his dad got home he went upstairs and sat on the end of his son‚Äôs bed.

""So I hear you got into a lot of trouble today. Tell me what happened."" 

The boy answered, ""When I was on my way to school today, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant, so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal‚Äôs office. When I got there he asked me what had happened and I told him everything and he asked me what the words were and when I told him he freaked out and expelled me. When I got home mom asked me what had happened and I told her everything and she asked me what the words were. When I told her she sent me up here to wait for you.""

‚ÄúWell, son, what are the words?""

""Stark Sky."" the boy replied. 

His father exploded and kicked him out of the house. 

As he was wandering around he ran into some friends. They crowded round the boy.

""What's going on, man? We heard you got expelled and your dad kicked you out!"" 

So the boy said,"" When I was on my way to school today, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal‚Äôs office. When I got there he asked me what had happened and I told him everything and he asked me what the words were and when I told him he freaked out and expelled me.

He asked me what happened and after I told him everything he asked me the words and when I told him he kicked me out."" 

""Wow, what are the words?"" his friends asked. 

""Stark Sky,"" he replied. 

All of his friends jumped him and started beating him up until a bum came by and scared them off. 

""I just saved your life,‚Äù said the bum. ‚ÄúTell me why they were all beating you up."" 

The boy slowly picked himself up off the floor and turned to face the bum.

""When I was on my way to school today, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant, so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal‚Äôs office.

I ran into my friends and they asked me why I had been expelled and kicked out of my house and I told them everything and then they asked what the words were. When I told them, they beat me up."" 

""So, what on Earth are the words?"" the bum asked. 

""I don't know if I should say,‚Äù said the boy. 

""Come on. I just saved your life, don't be ungrateful,"" the bum remarked. 

""Okay, okay. The words were Stark Sky."" 

The bum freaks out and starts beating the boy up until a cop comes along and breaks it up. The bum ran off leaving the shaken boy to be helped to his feet by the police officer. The cop asks the boy what happened. 

‚ÄúWell, when I was on my way to school today, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal‚Äôs office.

The bum came by and scared them off, he then asked me what had happened and I told him everything. Then he asked what the words were and when I told him he began beating me up."" 

‚ÄúWhat were the words?"" pried the police officer. 

The boy replied, ""Stark Sky."" 

Appalled, the cop put the boy into hand cuffs, beat him up and took him to jail. 

The next day the boy appeared before a judge. The judge asked him for his story. 
The boy answered, "" When I was on my way to school yesterday, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal‚Äôs office.

Then a cop came by and broke it up and after explaining the story to him he asked what the words were and when I told him he handcuffed me and took me to jail."" 

""What were the words, Boy?"" demanded the Judge. 

The boy said, ""Haven't you been paying any attention? I'm not going to tell you."" 

The judge informed him that he would be found in contempt of court if he didn't answer him and say the words. Reluctantly, he obeyed. 

""Stark Sky."" 

The judge was outraged and sentenced him to ten years in jail. 

Everyone was curious about their new cell mate, so they asked him what he was in for.

""Well, when I was on my way to school one day, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal‚Äôs office.

The next day I had to go to court and the judge asked me what happened and I told him everything and then he asked me the words and when I told him he gave me ten years."" 

Everyone was amazed at the story and asked what the words were. Sighing deeply the boy replied, ""Stark Sky.‚Äù 

He spent the next ten years getting beaten up. 

The day he was released he met a beautiful woman. 

""You look like you've had a very rough time. What happened?"" 

The man coughed and cleared his throat. ""When I was on my way to school one day, I saw some words written on a wall and I didn't know what they meant so when the teacher asked if there were any questions I asked her what they meant and she yelled at me and sent me to the principal‚Äôs office.

All of my cell mates asked me what the words were and I just sighed and told them. I have spent the last ten years getting beat up."" 

""Oh that is just awful!"" the woman exclaimed. ""What were the words?"" 

""Do you think I'm stupid?!"" exploded the man. ""I'm not going to tell you the words."" 

""Oh come on,"" the woman cooed. ""I won't do anything to you."" 

""Oh, alright. The words were Stark Sky."" 

""Stark Sky?"" asked the woman with her eyes lit up. 

""Yes,"" the man replied. 

""You see that hotel across the street? If you meet me there in one hour I will tell you the meaning of Stark Sky."" 

The man was ecstatic. He was finally going to learn what Stark Sky meant after all of this time. Once the hour was up, he set off for across the street in a hurry. As he stepped off the curb, he was hit by a bus. 

The moral of the story: Look both ways before crossing the street.

A fleeing Taliban terrorist, desperate for water, was plodding through the Afghan desert when he saw something
far off in the distance. Hoping to find water, he hurried toward the mirage, only to find a very frail little Jewish man
standing at a small makeshift display rack selling ties.

The Taliban terrorist asked, ""Do you have water?""

The old man replied, ""I have no water. Would like to buy a tie? They are only $5.""

The Taliban shouted hysterically, ""Idiot Infidel! I do not need such an overpriced western adornment.¬†
I spit on your ties. I need water!""

""Sorry, I have none, just ties - pure silk, and only $5.""

""Pahh! A curse on your ties! I should wrap one around your scrawny little neck and choke the life out of you,
but I must conserve my energy and find water!""

""Okay,"" said the little old Jewish man. ""It does not matter that you do not want to buy a tie from me,
or that you hate me, threaten my life, and call me Infidel. I will show you that I am bigger than any of that.¬†
If you continue over that hill to the east for about two miles, you will find a restaurant. It has the finest food
and all the ice-cold water you need. Go in peace.""

Cursing him again, the desperate Taliban staggered away, over the hill.

Several hours later he crawled back, almost dead, and gasped, ""They won't let me in without a tie...""",NSFW

"Long ago, there was a cathedral... The old bell ringer had passed away and the bishop set out a sign announcing that the position was now open for new applicants.  A few weeks go by without  any bites, but one day a man comes in.  The man had a hunched back and no arms, so the bishop was leary of his ability to perform the job, but the Lord teaches love and acceptance of all.  He says to the man, ""if you can climb into the tower and ring the bell, the position is yours.""  

Elated, the armless man runs up the tower stairs, bypassing the rope that one would normally use, but that he was unable to manipulate.  At the top of the stairs, there was ladder to get into the belfry.  Without hesitation, he climbs the ladder using his teeth, and beams as he looks upon the church's bell.  He backs into the corner of the belfry, takes a deep breath, and runs at the bell full speed.  He slams into the bell, it swings and tolls beautifully.   The bishop kept his word and awarded the man the job.

Weeks go by, and all seems right with the world.  The armless man enjoys his new life, but sometimes, he gets a little dizzy tolling the higher hours.  One day, while performing his duty to mark noon, he misses the bell altogether and sails out the far side of the tower.  He falls to his death, and a crowd gathers around the body.  In the general murmur, a voice calls out, ""does anyone know this man?""  Another replies...

""No, but his face sure rings a bell!""

With a heavy heart, the bishop places out the sign once more, advertising the open position.  Again, weeks pass without a single taker, until another man arrives.  His resemblance to the previous man is uncanny.  A hunched back, no arms, and nearly identical in appearance.  The bishop is dubious, fearful of a repeat of the recent tragedy, but the man falls to his knees, weeping and pleading, and against his better judgement, the bishop makes him the same offer.  The hunchback climbs into the belfry, backs into the corner, runs and tolls the bell, claiming the job.

To ensure the new ringer's safety, the bishop commissions the installation of bars across the open sides of the tower, and life continues on.  Over the next few years, the hunchback enjoys his life within the cathedral.   He is well cared for, and happy to perform his duty, though the midday ringings do tend to take their toll, and like his predecessor, he misses once in a while, but the bars give him security.  Unfortunately, the bars are not maintained, they rust, and at last, they give.  The armless man tumbles out of the tower and falls to his death.  Once more, a crowd gathers, and again, someone calls out, ""does anyone know this man?""  And a voice replies...

""No, but he sure is a dead ringer for his brother!""",NSFW

""I'll look into it,"" said Mr. Jordan as he walked into the coaches' room. 47 minutes later, the entire list of the squad was posted by the door with the corresponding number of each player. Bob saw that he got 77 and immediately went next to the coach in frustration. ""Hey, Mr. Jordan! I really thought you were going to give me the 7. Why didn't you do it? I am one of the top players in this team and I think I deserved it!"" Mr. Jordan replied: ""What the hell kid, 77 is even better!

A boy at the stage's edge lifts the top off of a small box, and out comes a fly, buzzing toward the samurai. In a flash the samurai draws his katana and returns it to its sheath. The fly falls to the stage in two perfect halves. The Emperor and the people of his court applaud.  

The second samurai, of middle-age, comes out on stage. Again, the boy releases a fly, and it buzzes toward the samurai. In a blink the katana slices through the air and returns to its sheath. The fly falls to the stage, and the boy rushes to it, excitedly exclaiming: ""The fly lives, but the samurai removed its wings!"" The Emperor and the people of his court applaud and cheer in wonder.

The third samurai, the eldest and most respected in the service of the Emperor, walks onto the stage. The boy opens the final box, and the fly travels toward the samurai. With the sing of metal, in one fluid motion, the old samurai draws and returns his sword to its sheath. And the fly keeps buzzing through the air.

But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond.

Now, it so happened that one of the days was the coming Sunday. So, the pastor called in sick instead of preaching and had a junior pastor substitute for him.

The local golf course had a nasty 18th hole, most golfers had a 2 handicap on it, even professionals would balk at this hole, a hole in one was never heard of ever.

So our pastor is happily teeing off and scribbling his scores and having a jolly good time instead of preaching. The angel Gabriel sees him and gets angry and goes to God.

Gabriel: My Lord this fool has forsaken his flock to pursue his foolish entertainment. You should punish him.

God: Hmmmm, all in time.

Meanwhile our pastor has completed the 17th hole and is doing better than usual and is beside himself as he readies to tee off for the 18th.

Gab: This is the last hole Lord, please show your fury. Blast this ignorant man with lightning.

God: Hmmmmmm

Our pastor tees off and the stroke is brilliant, the ball sails like it has wings and the wind is under it and like a miracle drops on the green and rolls right into the hole. A hole in one, the impossible.

Our pastor jumps in joy, has tears in his eyes and is literally going crazy.

Gab: Lord, what was that, I know you did that. You should punish him. 

God: This was punishment.

Gab: This was no less than the greatest reward in his life.

"This is the only joke I have ever thought of that was (maybe) worth reposting  

Long ago, in a land with giants and dragons there lived a very successful man.  He made his wealth trading furs, dire wolf cloaks, unicorn hide gloves, tanned kraken belts, dragon scale boots, he traded in them all.  This man, however had stopped sitting for any reason, so he would often dominate a room with his tall stature and commanding presence. Why? You may ask, and that is simple, he would always fall out of any seat in which he sat.  His mantra began as much as an explanation as it was a focus during long hours of debate, trade, or travel: ‚ÄùI am bad at sitting.‚Äù  Those around him believed him cursed, to find a seat was thought impossible. The man was simply very bad at sitting correctly, and due to his stubbornness he decided it was the chairs fault and not his own.  This lead to many, often funny circumstances, and harrowing adventures.  

Using his vast wealth and political connections he sought help from the greatest mages of the east.  The mages, certain they could create a chair of such comfort, and natural balance that there is no way the man could fail to sit in it properly.  Alas, the man could not get comfortable or remain seated for more than a few moments, and thus he shunned the mages for their incompetence.  

After the unfortunate failings of the mages he traveled to the west, where the greatest warriors in all the realms of man made their homes.  He went from town to town, seeking the greatest of all the warriors, he found and gathered the greatest swordsman, the greatest axe wielder, the greatest archer, the greatest tracker, and even the master of the arenas: who was the finest duelist in the world.  From a traveling circus he gathered the best acrobats, those who could walk a quarter inch tightrope for miles without difficulty, with the ability to train others to do the same.  

The master swordsman was an ancient woman, who taught the merchant patience greater than any other man.  The axe wielder trained him in strength, that he was among the strongest men on earth.  The Archer taught him the bow, and to hold a steady position for hours, despite his body‚Äôs protests. The tracker taught him how to move lightly, he gained such control of his body he could traverse a lightly frozen pond without breaking the ice, or leaving a trace. The arena master taught him to duel, and how to maintain his focus in any circumstance. The acrobats taught him such balance that he could sit upon a sphere of stone, which sat upon a single spike of iron, and maintain this position for days.  

After years of training, and becoming one of the finest warriors, strongest men, best archers, most capable hunters, an equal to the master of the arena in a duel, and the third finest acrobat in the world, he still could not sit correctly in a chair.  He could stand on a chair, he could sleep while balanced on the back of the chair, but he could not sit as he should.  He tried for months, patient as the stone he would perch upon.  After 17 more Moons, he decided that though he had not given up, perhaps he should seek knowledge and skill that man could not provide. 

He traveled far to the north, through frozen passes, over the highest mountains, and descended the deepest valleys.  He had to hunt to survive, and all those he traveled with died on the untamed mountains.  He moved boulders five times his size, he traversed hills that mountain goats would gawk at.  In due time, he came to a great cave: the place he had lost so many friends - and so much time - to find.  He ventured into the cave, searching for the great white dragon, said to be as ancient as time itself.  Upon spotting the man, the dragon roared, loud enough to shake the mountains, and deafen any mortal, but the man stood firm, able to keep his calm in any situation.  The dragon, seeing this, used magic to heal the old merchant‚Äôs ears, and said ‚ÄòWhat do you want, a human of such strength and skill to reach me, and such nerve as to not cower before me?‚Äô Though the merchant did not understand the language of dragons, he thought he understood the intent of the question.  The man said ‚ÄúI am among the wealthiest merchants of the world, the strongest men on this plane, the finest hunter, and tracker known to man, an equal to the legendary duelists of the world, yet I can not sit in a chair.  The greatest teachers of men, and the best enchanters in the land could not train me, nor use magic to cheat me, into comfort, or even long term discomfort in a chair.  I am simply bad at it.

Unfortunately, the dragon did not know the human language very well, and due to gross miscommunication ate the man whole.  However, the man did not die, as he lay in the stomach of the dragon, he simply waited, knowing his life had come to an end.  Three days passed, the dragon feeling more and more ill as time went on.  On the fourth day the dragon‚Äôs mate returned, and asked him what was wrong.  

The Ancient dragon of the north replied ‚ÄúIt must have been something I ate, it‚Äôs just not sitting right‚Äù",SFW

"[Long] One of my favorite jokes from BoJack Horseman Okay so there's this gardener right?
So the amazing thing about this gardener is that he always knows exactly how many bags of mulch he needs for a job, just by looking. Like he gets it right, every time. He's the best.
So one day, he looks at a yard he's working on and he's like... 18 bags. So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags of mulch and goes to work. 
And when he's finished, the flower beds are amazing! Beautiful roses, beautiful lillies and beautfil orchid bushes.

But there's one problem, he still has 1 bag of mulch left. He can't believe it! This has never happened before.
Well, the extra bag of mulch drives him crazy, because he's THE GUY who always gets the right amount of mulch!

He's like... aaaH! Extra mulch! Oh no!

So... on the drive home, he throws the bag of mulch out the window, over the side of the freeway 101.

So, there's this couple who just started dating and things are going really well. One day the girl finds an old box of love letters from her highschool boyfriend. 
She reads them and just loves how silly they are, the drama of young romance.
So on a whim, she sends the letters to her ex-boyfriend thinking he might find them funny too!

So that night she tells her current boyfriend about it and he loses his shit.
They get in a huge fight about it. He's all like, ""Why would you send your ex the old love letters! He's going to think you're still in love with him!
And she's like, ""Relax Brandon!"" (The current boyfriends name btw)

Now the night is ruined because Brandon is obsessed. He's like, ""That ex-boyfriend is going to come back for you, he knows where you live!""

So after dinner he drives her home, she lives in one of those big apartment buildings by the freeway and he walks her to her door.

But he forgets to lock the car, and leaves the windows down.

He kisses her goodnight, but things are kind of wierd. Then he gets back in his car and starts to drive away. 
But when he glances in his rear view mirror his blood turns cold. Guess what's in the back seat?

"A man is driving down the road at midnight and his car breaks down near a mental hospital. He didn‚Äôt know what to do because he knew nothing about fixing cars. A mental patient who was watering some flowers saw the scene and walks towards the man. The man seeing the mental patient coming his way, gets scared and stays quiet in the car.  The madman tells the man..-‚ÄúGood night my friend. Do you want me to fix your car?‚Äù ... Since there was anything he can do , the man allows the mental patient to check his car.  After a few minutes the car was as good as new. The man couldn‚Äôt believe it .. he says ‚Äú Thanks man. You‚Äôre a master in mechanics.

‚ÄúGee, that‚Äôs tough!‚Äù commiserated the bartender.

‚ÄúRight, but that‚Äôs not what really got me aggravated,‚Äù the customer went on. ‚ÄúWhen her husband came into the room he said ‚ÄòHey great! You‚Äôre naked already! Let me just take a leak.‚Äô And damned if the lazy son of a bitch didn‚Äôt piss out the window right onto my head.‚Äù

‚ÄúYuk!‚Äù The bartender shook his head. ‚ÄúNo wonder you‚Äôre in a lousy mood.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but I haven‚Äôt told you what really, really got to me.

‚ÄúDamn, that really is a drag!‚Äù said the bartender.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm not finished. See what really pissed me off was when the husband had to take a dump. It turns out that their toilet is broken, so he stuck his ass out of the window and let loose right on my head!‚Äù

"The pink ping pong ball A wealthy man had a little boy. For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.

So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.

A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-'

The neighbor then says: ""I'll offer you a deal: We play a game where we kick each other in the balls until one of us gives up. The winner gets the duck. Sounds fair?"" 

The shooter thinks to himself that this is probably his best chance of getting the duck, so he agrees. The neighbor then says: ""Alright, since the duck landed in my backyard, I'll start."" 

So the neighbor kicks the shooter as hard as he can in balls, leaving the shooter crawling on the ground for a good ten minutes. Once he gets up, still shaking from the pain, he says: ""Alright, now it's my turn."" 

But then the neighbor just says: ""Nah, I give up, I'm a vegetarian"" and walks away.  ",NSFW

"A difficult marriage. A husband and wife were having marital struggles due to constant disagreements and an imbalance in responsibilities. The husband would come home from work and yell at his wife for not having dinner ready. The wife would yell at the husband for ignoring all the cleaning she's done when he tracked his muddy shoes in. They never tried to make each other happy anymore; it was just too much effort, and they were both tired. 

They tried counseling and therapy, and they were given many things to try. They set aside one night a week for date night, but they could never agree what to eat or what movie to watch. They made a list of chores, but could never agree who should be responsible for which chores. They tried to spend time with friends, but could never agree who's friends they would visit. 

Eventually the husband starting drinking. He would spend each night after work going to bars just so he wouldn't have to face going home. The wife started spending more time online chatting with strangers and fantasizing about meetups. The times they did spend together were filled with yelling and arguing. 

The husband starting carrying a flask with him wherever he went. He would wake up and immediately start drinking, and he wouldn't stop until he passed out at night. He could hardly remember what it felt like to be sober. 

The wife move from conversations online to coffee dates to motel infidelities. She never felt so alive as she did when driving to have sex with a stranger, and she never felt so worthless and dead inside as she did on the drive home. 

The husband and wife decided enough was enough. They would get divorced before the relationship became violent. They spent months fighting each other and arguing about who would get each little thing they owned. They brought in lawyers to fight for custody over simple things like the tennis rackets and the silverware set. They argued until the last minute before they turned in the paperwork the day before their court date. 

That day was just like all the others. The husband woke up, still a little drunk from the night before, and hit the bottle before speaking a word. The wife dolled herself up in the hopes she may meet a mysterious stranger at the courthouse and feel something other than sorrow. They got in the car and set out. 

The husband had barely pulled the car out of the driveway when the arguments started. He was drunk, but refused to let his wife drive. She hated his driving and wanted to listen to her music. It wasn't long before his anger got the best of him and he started driving erratically. He slammed on the gas and swerved around a corner. Their car smashed into a parked Honda. The airbags deployed as smoke billowed out of the engine. The car caught fire, and the husband and wife struggled to free themselves from the wreckage. The owner of the Honda arrived just in time to pull the couple from the burning car. 

Having been through a near death experience, the couple began to apologize for the first time in years through streaming tears and muffled sobs. The husband would stop drinking and help with the dishes. The wife would spend less time focused on herself and more time supporting her husband and the stress of his job. They were both sorry for the things they had done to each other. They decided they would work together, support each other, and try to make the relationship work. 

Two weeks later, the husband and wife were having lunch with their mutual friends. They were sober, honest, happy, in love, and most of all they were not arguing. Their friends noticed the clear difference in the relationship and said, ""Wow! It seems like you guys are doing so much better!""

The husband smiled at his wife and looked to their friends. He took a deep breath and said, ""Our lives are changed, and we couldn't be happier, and it's all because we finally struck an Accord.""",NSFW

When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery.

Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite.

The mechanic catches a quick glimpse of the car and tells the penguin, ""I'll go ahead and check it out. Come back in about 30 minutes and I'll have a diagnosis for you.""

""Alright then,"" replies the penguin as he waddles off on his merry way.

Trying to decide on how to kill some time he comes across an ice cream shop. The sun is relentlessly bearing down on him and an icy cold snack is sounding pretty refreshing right now so he heads on inside.

After grabbing a double-scoop of vanilla ice cream he begins his walk back towards the mechanic. He's enjoying himself munching down on his treat but it's melting and he's kind of making a mess all over himself.

He finally returns to the shop and grabs the mechanic's attention. Catching a whiff of the penguin's presence the mechanic says, ""So yeah, I think I figured out the problem."" He looks up at the penguin, ""It looks like you blew a seal.""

The penguin looks down at himself, ""Oh, no, it's just ice cream.""",NSFW

"Good Ol' Dave Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.
Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

The three men devised a plan to figure out what was going on. They got on a plane and flew to Israel, determined to find out what was converting their sons!

"A Trip to the Psychic of Piccadilly Lane A man driving his morning route spots an old corrugated plastic sign planted in the brown, yet overgrown yard of a decrepit house. The once-colorful sign reads ""Psychic readings performed; $20.00 per palm reading, first question answered FREE."" The man, intrigued, decides that he could skip his usual Starbucks stop in exchange for a new experience, and pulls off to the side of the road.

As he gets out of his car, he notices a strange look about the house. First off, the house is covered in a bright purple paint which has been badly chipped from many years baking in the sun. Secondly, none of the house's openings are level: windows are cracked and crooked, and the front door is slanted to the left. And, strangely enough, there is no paved pathway to the front door; simply worn grass, then patio, then door.

Despite all of these oddities, the man proceeds to walk from his car, up the oil-stained driveway, across the path of matted-down brown grass, onto the crumbling concrete patio, and knocks on the old oak door with a resounding *thunk* *thunk*

But before the man could knock a third time, the door swung open, revealing a plump elderly lady dressed in a thick red cloak decorated many translucent pink scarves. The man is taken aback by how quickly she answered the door, especially because of how old and out of shape she apparently was.

The lady in red introduces herself as the psychic in a flamboyant, yet obviously rehearsed way:

""I am the psychic of Piccadilly Lane!""

She continues, pointing at the man ""You have come to have your future seen, your misfortunes foretold, and your successes predicted!""

The man, still a little confused by the woman's quickness at answering the door, is actually impressed by the psychic's act, assuring himself that this was going to be far more entertaining than his planned trip to Starbucks.

The psychic then proceeds to calmly invite the man into her home, and he follows. Decidedly, the inside of the psychic's home is far stranger than the outside. Bookcases line the walls with literature written in many different languages: Latin, English, Greek, French, and even a few the man was unable to identify. Sitting atop the bookcases are dusty knick-knacks ranging from snow globes and creepy red-fabric dolls to broken crystal balls and a cuckoo clock the man swears is running backwards.

He follows the lady into a warm and poorly-lit room draped in cotton and lace curtains. In the center is a card table covered with an elaborately-weaved purple and gold tablecloth. On the table is a glowing crystal ball sitting atop a beautifully engraved wooden bowl. The engravings show scenes of both erotic pleasure and horrible torture that the man hopes are symbolic for life rather than his own personal future. He is then directed to one of two deeply tan leather chairs parked on either side of the table. After both the Psychic and the man sat down, she addresses the man:

""Sir, as you may have read up front, I can see the answer to any question you pose me, and I answer the first question free of charge. So, think deeply about what you wish to ask.""

The man, after a few seconds, speaks to the psychic: ""So I can ask you any question and you will answer it?""

""Yes, to the best of my ability""

The man nods, satisfied, and leaves.",NSFW

"A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss.  A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss. When the boss came, the story began.

-The client: is room 39 empty?

-The boss: yes, sir.

-The client: can I book it?

-The boss: of course you can.

-The client: thank you.
Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up.

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''

-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.

-''Swear''

-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''

So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.

When he does, I will let you know... thank you for reading.",NSFW
"Victor liked to reminisce of his high school days and asked his neighbors to call him The Victor The Victor was also a gardener and  wanted to stop buying fertilizer because it costed him too much money. He decided to start composting instead, but he lived alone so he didn‚Äôt make enough waste for his compost. Finally he decided to go door to door asking his neighbors for their spoiled food to add to his compost. This continued for a while until a new woman moved into the neighborhood. She had noticed the man walking around the neighborhood and people dropping stuff into his bucket, she wondered what was going on. She thought maybe it was money for donations, or maybe cans for recycling. Eventually she grew tired of wondering and asked her next door neighbor who that man was and what the people were dropping in his bucket. The neighbor replied ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs The Victor and...‚Äù ‚ÄúWoah woah woah, THE Victor?‚Äù Questions the woman.  ‚ÄúYeah that was his high school nick name, he was the quarterback on he team and when he played his team was always the victor.‚Äù The woman now understood who he was but still needed to know what ended up in his bucket.

"The Lord will take care of me   Mr. Jackson was a devout Southern Baptist. He spent his entire life in dedicated service to the Lord. He never missed a church service, or an opportunity to demonstrate his great faith in The Father.

   One Sunday morning the congregation of Mr. Jackson's church were gathered for service, and there was a palpable tension in the air. When the pastor stood to deliver the sermon, he addressed the uneasy feelings of the parishioners. ""I'm sure most of you are aware of the severe weather expected to begin later today. It is being reported that extremely heavy rains, strong winds, and a strong likelihood of flooding for at least the next 10 days. As a result, I have decided to cut this morning's service short so that everyone can prepare for the challenges we are about to face."" He then concluded with a quick prayer for everyone's safety, and everyone headed to their homes to prepare.

   When the sun rose Monday morning, it had already been raining for about 14 hrs. Strong winds had downed trees all across the state. Power was out, rainfall levels were steadily rising, and roads were blocked with debris. The pastor called Mr. Jackson to check on him. ""Several of the church members are working together to get food and supplies out to our church family. Is there anything you need?""  ""The Lord will take care of me"", Mr. Jackson replied.

     By Wednesday the storm had intensified to record levels. Flood waters had risen to the point that the governor had ordered an evacuation. The men of the church got their boats and worked through the day to get folks to safety. They were stunned when they pulled up to Mr. Jackson's house and were promptly dismissed. ""No need to waste precious time here... The Lord will take care of me"" he called to them from an upstairs window before turning them away.

   The sun rose Friday morning to reveal the town completely covered by water.  Rooftops peeking out here and there were the only signs left of the town. The National Guard, Coast Guard, and several local military units were searching the area to rescue anyone who hadn't evacuated. A Coast Guard officer spotted Mr. Jackson perched on the peak of his roof and directed a rescue boat to retrieve him. ""Go save someone who needs the help"" Mr. Jackson called out. ""The Lord will take care of me.""  No matter how much the officer tried to reason with him, he would not budge. The officer radioed in to the commander and advised him of Mr. Jackson's refusal. The commander ordered a helicopter crew to retrieve Mr. Jackson, willing or not. Try as they might, they could not get him to leave.  The last thing they heard of Mr. Jackson as they flew away was, ""The Lord will take care of me.""

  Mr. Jackson was swallowed up by the flood, and his soul was transported to heaven. As he stood before The Lord, he could not contain his confusion. ""Lord, I lived a faithful life, I followed your laws and commandments, attended church, and in the end you let me drown! I believed with all my heart you would take care of me, but you let me die!""

 The Lord looked down from his heavenly throne and said,"" Damn Jackson, I sent a preacher, two boats, and a helicopter! What more did you want!?""

"A disheveled man with a backpack stumbles into a bar, Pulls up a stool, drops the backpack at his feet, and ushers the bartender over.

‚ÄúWhat can I get for you sir?‚Äù The bartender polishes a small glass and looks the bedraggled man up and down.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù The man ushers him closer conspiratorially, obviously slightly intoxicated. ‚ÄúI want to make a deal with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the deal?‚Äù The bartender asks, leaning away as the man leans closer.

‚ÄúThe deal is, if you give me a free shot of whiskey, I will show you the most AMAZING thing you have ever seen in your entire life!‚Äù The man gestures wildly.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù The bar tender raises a suspicious eyebrow. ‚ÄúAnd what if it‚Äôs not the most amazing thing I‚Äôve ever seen in my entire life?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh I‚Äôll pay.‚Äù The man pulls out a couple wadded twenties from his pocket and shows the bartender. ‚ÄúDeal?‚Äù

The bar tender shrugs, pours him a shot of whiskey, and slides it over.

The man downs the shot of whiskey in one gulp, sucks through his teeth, nods satisfactorily, and bends down to rummage in his backpack. A moment later he reemerges with a very small man wearing a fancy tuxedo; tails, white spats, greased black hair, the works. The man takes a couple distinguished bows as the normal sized man disappears under the bar again and comes back up with a tiny grand piano and a bench.

‚ÄúWell, if you give me another free shot of whiskey, I‚Äôll tell you.‚Äù The man looks from his empty glass to the bartender.

‚ÄúSure! Of course!‚Äù The bar tender pours him a large shot and sets in down in front of him.
The man downs the shot of whiskey in one gulp, sucks through his teeth, nods satisfactorily, and bends down to rummage in his backpack. A moment later he reemerges with a Persian looking, slightly tarnished oil lamp, and slides it across to the bartender.

The bartender picks up the lamp, rubs it, and out pops a wrinkly old genie from a cloud of purple smoke.

‚ÄúOh, um, okay‚Äù The bartender scratches his head before shrugging. ‚ÄúHow about a million bucks?‚Äù

When he looked at the sky he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be like.

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

But being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded.

One day Wally's mum came to school to check on how he was doing. The teacher told his mum honestly, that her son is simply a disaster, getting very low marks and even she had never seen such a dumb boy in her entire teaching career.  

The mum was shocked at the feedback and withdrew her son from the school and even moved out of Sydney, went north to Newcastle.  

25 years later, the teacher was diagnosed with an incurable cardio disease.  All the doctors strongly advised her to have heart surgery, which only one
surgeon at the John Hunter Hospital could perform
Left with no other options, the teacher decided to have the operation, which was successful. When she opened her eyes after the surgery she saw a
handsome doctor smiling down at her.  

She wanted to thank him, but could not talk. Her face started to turn blue, she raised her hand, trying to tell him something but eventually died.

"The Curse of the Twang It was a winters night, and the traveller struggled up the lonely snow filled road path toward the farm house where two lights shone out into the darkness sending hope to a weary man. 

Knocking on the door, the traveller shivered as he waited for someone to answer. Eventually, he heard the sliding of a bolt, the handle turned with a creak, and the farmer, holding a torch peered out into the cold night.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù asked the farmer.

‚ÄúI am lost, my car broke down, and I was hoping to call for some help.‚Äù

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt got no phone.‚Äù replied the farmer, beginning to close the door over.

‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù called the traveller, more loudly than he wanted, ‚ÄúDo you have a room I can stay in for the night? I promise to be no trouble. If I stay out here I will freeze to death.‚Äù

Pausing for longer than the traveller liked, the farmer opened the door further.

‚ÄúSuppose..‚Äù

Not waiting for the man to change his mind, the traveller stepped quickly into the hallway closing the door behind him.

‚ÄúCome with me.‚Äù turning, the farmer began walking to the stairs, and began to climb.

With the traveller following, they eventually reached a door at the top of the stair. Holding the handle, the farmer paused, doubt crossing his face.

‚ÄúAlright, here is your room, but before we go in, I need you to know something.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù asked the traveller.

‚ÄúThis is my daughters room. She is a fine lass, but a bit dim witted. I am going to trust you to share a bed with her ‚Äòcos it‚Äôs the only spare one we have see? But, if you try anything...well, be warned, the Curse of the Twang will befall you, alright?‚Äù

The traveller suppressed a yell of ‚ÄúYes! Get in my son!‚Äù only managing a timid squeak, ‚ÄúCurse of the Twang?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYes, its a curse see? And well, it comes to those who touch my beautiful daughter see?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, you have my word sir. On my honour.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair enough then.‚Äù

Opening the door, the farmer led the man into the room. ‚ÄúThis is my daughter Aileen.‚Äù

There sitting in bed was a twenty something buxom woman. The traveller nearly giggled, ‚ÄúAnd you are fine with me to share this bed with you lady?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yes, for the curse will protect me.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù said the farmer, ‚Äúbest be getting some sleep then.

With that the farmer left closing the door. The traveller wasting precious little time, got undressed and slipped into the bed beside the farmers daughter.

With the lights off, the traveller started to get a little fresh, with a tickle and a playful squeeze. The farmer‚Äôs daughter giggled and played along.

Suddenly, the door opened and the farmer stood there. ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt trying anything are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Not me.‚Äù replied the traveller.

‚ÄúMind that curse fella.‚Äù said the farmer and closed the door.

Well, as you can imagine one thing led to another and deeds were done. The traveller, happy and satisfied, fell into a blissful sleep.. ‚Äúwhat curse?‚Äù he thought to himself...

‚ÄúOi you, fella!‚Äù the traveller was suddenly awake, shocked and trying to come to his senses. The farmer daughter was still in bed beside him and the farmer was standing by the bedroom window holding a rock. the farmer hefted the rock in his hand and the traveller could see it had a piece of paper wrapped around it and some string attached.

‚ÄúI warned you that the curse of the Twang would come to you if there was no good going on with my daughter. I‚Äôve tied this rock to your left ball.‚Äù and with that the farmer threw the rock high out of the window into the night sky.

Without a moments hesitation the traveller leapt out the window, and falling toward the soft snow below he caught the rock in mid air. There on the paper wrapped around the rock he saw some words....he could hear them speaking to him in the farmers voice.

‚ÄúI tied your right ball to the bed post.‚Äù

"Mr. Dick Mr. Dick grew up in the suburbs of a lower-middle-class growing community in southern Alabama. He would often wonder how in the world it came to be that his last name was Dick. ""What a god-awful last name that is,"" he would often muse. However, Mr. Dick wasn't the kind of person that would let something as mundane as an unfortunate last name bring him down. He owned it.

Throughout his adolescent and teenage years, his friends made fun of him, but he didn't take it personally. He took the high road and decided to laugh with them. In doing so, he nevertheless maintained a respectable degree of popularity and wasn't an outcast. He would make jokes with his friends that, someday when he has a son, he would name him Harry. That way his name would be Harry Dick. He was so committed to this joke in fact, that when he actually did have a child, he actually went through with it and named *her* Harry.

That's right. Did I stutter? No, I fucking didn't because I'm typing and that wouldn't make sense. His first and only child was a daughter and he didn't want to miss the opportunity, so his first and only child's name was Harry Dick.

What a shitty name for the poor girl growing up... Like, what's she going to do with that when she's being made fun of in school? You can't just laugh that one off like it's all good. She got bullied and outcasted hard. Over the years, growing towards teenagehood, she grew a bitter hatred for her dad. How could he do such a thing to his own daughter, putting her through all of this misery? Asshole.

At the age of 13, she discovered that it was possible to change her name. Upon this discovery, she instantly became heart-set on finding some kind of employment, some kind of allowance, anything to earn the required $400 necessary to make the change. She mowed lawns, she did babysitting, and she saved every bit of holiday money she could from relatives. In the span of 6 months, she worked and worked until she was finally able to afford the $400 bill.

It was a Monday. Sunshine poured endless through her window that morning dawning the beginning of her new era. Finally, she could have a fresh start. She could fit in. She could defeat the bullying. Skipping breakfast, she ran outside, hopped on her bike, and rushed to the courthouse with her money.

Perhaps a little too fast, unfortunately. As she was rounding the corner to the courthouse without looking out for traffic, a huge truck smashed Harry Dick right in the face. The Driver just happened to be her father, Mr. Dick. Struck with an unimaginable sense of shock and disbelief, he practically fell out of his truck and rushed to Harry Dick's aid. The faint cacophony of sirens in the distance growing closer and closer was drowned out by an incapacitating drought of any semblance of positive emotion as Mr. Dick fell to his knees and cradled his daughter. Her body felt limp. Waiting there with his daughter for the emergency response to arrive was the longest two minutes and twenty-one seconds of his life.

After intense emergency care, it was finally resolved that Harry Dick was in a comatose state, and the doctors couldn't say how long it would take for her to wake up.

Horrifically, it would take Harry Dick 18 years to wake up. When she finally did, her dad was called right away. Mr. Dick couldn't believe it. His daughter has finally woken up. He had completely given up hope after the first two years. They even had a memorial service after five years.

When she woke up, she could barely remember anything. She could remember some names of people. She was able to recognize her father when he arrived, and she remembered that she hated him for naming her something so ridiculous and unfitting. Even after the eighteen-year coma, she had enough bitterness inside of her to not even want to talk to her father.

With all of the medical bills stacked up over the last two decades, Harry Dick would be drowning in debt for likely the rest of her life. Despite that, she still wanted to find the measly $400 necessary to change her name. It's been a long time coming, and especially with her aged complexion, her diminished literacy skills, her painful muscular atrophy, her likely permanent disabled state, her lack of a circle of friends to seek guidance from, and everything else that makes her life a nightmare, she really needed this one thing for herself. This one thing to find some degree of resolve in her pitiful life.

Her dad, understanding this, decides to front the money for this name change for all the damage he's caused in her life, even though he really couldn't afford it himself. It was the least he could do.

He drives her to the courthouse. He helps her into a wheelchair and strolls her into the building. They get the paperwork as an administrator, shocked to even hear of such a horrible name of a poor woman in such a horrible state, asks to speak to Harry Dick personally and privately in her office without Mr. Dick present.

Their conversation begins with her struggling to communicate her complex emotions as she tries to retell the story of her tragic life. Everything that's happened to her... the bullying, the work she did, the fateful Monday morning that ruined her life... The administrator couldn't believe what she was hearing. As a gesture of good faith and humanity, the administrator told Harry Dick that she would personally pay for this documentation to be processed, and that she deserved something nice to happen in her life. The look on Harry's face crevassed something that barely resembled a smile on her contorted face as one tear lead to two, and two tears lead to three. The administrator resolutely asked her what she wanted her new name to be. A resounding sniffle encompassed the majority of Harry's following dramatic pause. Finally, she declared as triumphantly as she could muster, ""I'd like my last name to be changed to Vagina.""",NSFW

"The Sensitive Man A woman meets a man in a bar.  They talk; they connect; they end up leaving together..
 

They get back to his place, and as he shows her around his apartment she notices that one wall of his bedroom is Completely filled with soft, sweet, cuddly teddybears.

There are three shelves in the bedroom, with hundreds and hundreds of cute, Cuddly teddy bears carefully placed in rows, covering the entire wall!

It's obvious that he has taken quite some time to lovingly arrange them. She's immediately touched by the amount of thought he put into organizing the display.

There are small bears all alongThe bottom shelf, Medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and Huge, enormous bears running
 
All the way along the top shelf.

She finds it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large collection of teddy bears.  She is quite impressed by his sensitive side, but don't mention this to him. 

They share a bottle of wine and
continue talking.  After awhile, she finds herself thinking,  ""Oh my God! Maybe, this guy could be the one!  Maybe he could be the future father of my children?"" 
 

She turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips. 

He responds warmly.  They continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her into his bedroom, where they rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love.
 
 

She is so overwhelmed that she responds with more passion, more creativity, more heat than she has ever known. 
 

After an intense, explosive night of raw passion with this sensitive guy, they are lying there together in the afterglow.
 

The woman rolls over, gently
Strokes his chest and asks coyly, 

'Well, how was it?' 
 

 
The guy gently smiles at her, strokes her cheek, looks deeply into her eyes, and says:

"Honestly proposing to my wife was a mistake I was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate Joseph barged into the room out of nowhere, tripped, and fell over, breaking a glass table with his face. Totally ruined the mood. Now I don't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let's say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those big cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend.

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

In conclusion, if it hadn't been for Joe with his cotton eye, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?",NSFW

"Childhood Friends So I grew up in a small town. Like really small, we're talking 900 people. So small that you know basically everyone in town. So when you grow up in a town that small, with a rather *aged* population, you don't really get to pick your friends. There were 6 boys my age in town, so those boys ended up being my friends, for better or for worse.

As time moved on, I grew wiser (as wise as  a teenager can get, I guess). I saw what was happening around me. Now, what I noticed about small town USA is that you really had to get out when you were young, or risk never really getting out at all. That's just the way that small town life can be, it sort of lulls you to sleep and suddenly you're 32 with 2 kids and never really get out of that style of living.

I have no qualms with that, but it just wasn't for me. I got out the first chance I got, and that chance was college. I now live a very happy, and very different life. I love the bustle of the city, the life and excitement it brings, but sometimes I look back at that small town life.

Not all of my friends made it out of that small farm town. In fact, only 1 other guy did.  I still keep in touch with them, but heading back home is a very rare occurrence for me; I work and go to school in the city now, not to mention the long trek back home. This results in my only heading home a couple, maybe three times a year.

I still love my friends, though, and I always make sure to get the gang back together whenever I come home. I mean, these guys basically were my childhood. All of our shared memories and experiences, the stories to recall and exploits to tell, we never have a dull moment when we get back together. 

And without fail, every single time, the first thing we do once we're all back together is all get in one of our cars. Make sure we lock all the doors, and plug in some of our best tunes. Finally we slide it into reverse, and boy does it bring me back.",NSFW

You haven't done any testing on him or anything. I want another opinion!""  With that, the vet turned and left the room. In a few moments, he returned with a Labrador retriever. The Retriever went right to work, sniffing and prodding, checking the poor dead dog out thoroughly. After a considerable amount of sniffing, the Retriever sadly shook his head and said, ""Bark"". 

The veterinarian then took the Labrador out and returned in a few moments with a cat, which also checked out the poor dog on the table. As had his predecessors, the cat sadly shook his head and said, ""Meow."" He then jumped off the table and ran out of the room.  The veterinarian handed the man a bill for $600.

"A Little Tale of Timmy (x-post from /r/long_jokes) Timmy loved tractors. When he was growing up his room was covered in them. He had tractor wallpaper, a tractor bed, tractor sheets, tractor pillowcases, not to mention all of the tractor toys he would lovingly play with every day. 

On Timmy's 13th birthday his parents decided to take him to a farm and let him ride on a tractor. Timmy was excited that his dream of riding on a tractor was finally becoming reality. After about 30 minutes of being driven around, the farmer offered Timmy a quick go behind the wheel. Timmy was thrilled, nothing could make him happier. As Timmy drove around the field he started to become more and more confident, when suddenly, disaster struck. Timmy, now not really concentrating on where he was going, hit a bump in the field and the tractor lost control and hit a tree. The farmer managed to escape but Timmy was caught between the tractor and the tree and passed out from the pain. 

Timmy awoke a week later in his local hospital; both of his parents were so relieved that he was awake they almost crushed him again. Unfortunately both of Timmy's legs were broken as well as his lower back. It took Timmy 2 and a half years to finally be back in control over his body and after months or grueling physiotherapy he was finally able to get back home. When he walked into his tractor covered room he almost broke down in tears. Timmy hated Tractors. Timmy never wanted to see another tractor again and so the next day his walls were stripped, his bedding changed and his toys put away and Timmy tried to move on with his life. 

Throughout his life growing up Timmy started to put the whole tractor incedent behind him and focus on his new goals in life such as a job or house or even a girlfriend but he never got rid of that hatred of all things tractor. 

We now see Timmy in his mid 20's life's been good to him. He has a good job and has just moved into a new flat in a nice part of town. He pops into a bar on his way home from work for a quick drink. The bar was thick with smoke and Timmy could barley see in front of him. As he went up to the bar he noticed the most beautiful lady he had ever seen in his life. She had long golden hair that fell gracefully from her head. Her eyes were a deep green and her lips a dark red. As Timmy was thinking of something to say to her he noticed a single tear running down her cheek. ""Beautiful lady why are you crying"" Timmy asked. She looked up at him and explained that all the smoke was hurting her eyes and she was struggling to breath. Timmy new it was his time to shine. ""Never fear"" he said and stood up on the bar. He then took a deep breath and sucked in all the smoke from the bar; everyone was now staring at him as he casualy walked outside and exhaled all the smoke into the atmosphere. As he walked back in he heard the woman cry ""how on earth did you do that?!"" ""It's easy,"" Timmy replied ""I'm an ex tractor fan.""",NSFW

"A man that was recently fired from his job and divorced decided to move to the mountains..... He decided to live a secluded and solitary life in the most remote regions of the Appalachian Mountainous he could find. His first year was tougher than he expected especially during the winter months, but he faired well all things considered.

On a warm day during the following spring, he was outside his cabin making repairs, when he noticed something coming down the the side of the mountain to his north.  The man grabbed his binoculars and scanned across the side of the nearby mountain.

It was another person! He observed that the individual was headed in his direction and was almost to the valley below him. Having spent the past year in seclusion he was excited to have some human interaction.

After a good while, the approaching stranger had made it through the valley and was approaching the man's cabin. Peering through his binoculars once more, the man saw that it was another man, about the same age as him wearing shabby clothing.

More time passed and finally the stranger arrived at the man's cabin. The stranger tipped his hat to the man and stated with a booming voice, ""Welcome to the neighborhood! I came here to invite you to a party at my cabin over yonder on the other mountain.""

The man was stunned. He had no idea that there was another human within several miles of him, let alone enough people to throw a party. The man asked the stranger ""What kind of party can you have in the middle of no where?""

The stranger grinned at the man. ""Oh you're gonna love this kinda party! There's gonna be some eatin' and drinkin' and fightin' and fuckin'!!"" The man's mind ran wild with anticipation and he excitedly took the stranger up on 

The man grabbed his coat and started following the stranger down into the valley below. All of the sudden it struck him, not wanting to be rude, the man asked, ""Hey, should I bring anything to the party?"" To which the stranger replied with a smile, ""Naw! It's just going to be the two of us.""",NSFW

"Lee Smart was always a trouble maker throughout his life. In school, Lee Smart was always getting in trouble. His friend, Isaac, always stuck by his side, though. They were always best friends. 

Though Isaac was getting sick of Lee‚Äôs crap. Lee kept drinking and driving, he kept smoking Marijuana and snorting Cocaine. Isaac was so close to just leaving Lee in the dust, knowing that he could probably find a better friend. But Isaac was too loyal, and kept by Lee‚Äôs side.

One day, Lee came to Isaac with a smirk on his face. He exclaimed that he had devised a plan for a bank heist. He wanted Isaac to help him execute the heist with him. He was going through the entire plan, and Isaac was just speechless with shock. He never thought that Lee would become a full-on criminal.

Lee pops the question to Isaac: ‚ÄúSo what do ya say? You in?‚Äù Isaac says with frustration, ‚ÄúWhat!? You‚Äôre insane, Lee Smart!‚Äù

"The Voodoo dick There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, ""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. ""Except what?"" the man asked. ""Nothing, nothing."" ""C'mon, tell me! I need something!"" ""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'"" ""So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" he asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!"" The old man replied, ""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet."" He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door."" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said ""Voodoo dick, get back in your box!"" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. ""I'll take it!"" said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say ""Voodoo dick, my pussy."" He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said ""Yeah, right.. Voodoo dick, my ass!""

"This happened in a little town in Northern Saskatchewan. Even though it sounds like an Alfred Hitchcock tale, it's true. Harry was on the side of the road hitchhiking on a very dark and stormy Halloween night. The night was getting darker and the rain came harder, and no cars went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly Harry saw a car come toward him and stop.

Without thinking about it, Harry got in the car and closed the door. Just as he realized there was nobody behind the wheel, the car started to move. As his panic set in, he looked at the road and saw a curve coming his way. Scared beyond belief, he started to pray, begging for his life. Just when the car got to the curve, and Harry thought it was all over, a hand appeared through the window and moved the wheel.

Harry was paralyzed in terror as he watched the hand appear every time the car got to a curve.

Gathering strength, Harry jumped out of the car and ran to the nearest town. Wet and in shock, he went to a bar and asked for two shots of rye. He started telling everyone about the horrible experience he went through. The crowd sat in an eerie silence when they realized that Harry was crying and wasn't drunk.

About half an hour later, two guys walked into the same bar. One said to the other, ""Look Pete, there's the jerk that got in the car when we were pushing it.""

He sat there waiting for the inevitable collapse into the dark deep abyss of nothingness he was soon to face.

The judge responds, ""That is true- you are responsible for those injured on your property if you neglect the condition of your house. What do you have to say for yourself?""


""It is not my fault..."" the house owner replies, ""it is the fault of the roofer! He is the one who made my roof so poorly!""

Hearing this, the judge orders that the roofer be brought to court.


""You have made his roof faulty, and therefore you are responsible for this poor man's injuries!"" the judge demands.


""No, it certainly is not my fault!"" the roofer replies, ""as I was adding the finishing touches to his roof, a beautiful girl wearing a stunning dress walked by, and I could not bear to keep my eyes off of her! Therefore, I was not able to pay attention to my handiwork, and so I inevitably neglected to complete the roof!""


The judge thinks for a while, and then immediately orders the beautiful girl into the courtroom.

""You have distracted the roofer with your beautiful dresses and are guilty for the injuries of this poor man. How do you explain yourself?""

""It is not our fault that our dresses are beautiful"" the girl responds, ""it was the last one that the merchant at the corner had in stock, and he had a special deal on it, and it was just so beautiful I could not resist purchasing it!""

The judge squints menacingly, and orders the merchant into the courtroom.

""You have sold this beautiful dress to this young woman, and therefore are responsible for the injuries of this poor man. How do you explain yourself?""

""Well.."" the merchant responds, ""I did not make the dress as beautiful as it is, I purchased it from the tailor across the river. I've been selling his dresses for him for as long as I can remember!""

The judge, as he has been doing, orders the tailor to the courtroom.

""You have made this beautiful dress, and therefore are responsible for the injuries of this poor man! How could you possibly defend yourself?""

""Well... um... you see..."" the tailor replies speechlessly.

""That's it, we have found the culprit, to the cell with him!"" the judge yells as he orders his guards to haul the man off to the prison cell.

However, once they reach the cell, they notice that the tailor is so tall that he is unable to stick his head underneath the cell door, making forcing him in it impossible.

""What shall we do now?"" the guard says. ""We cannot possibly get this man into the cell!""

"A Delta Airlines flight from Tel Aviv to New York A Delta Airlines flight from Tel Aviv to New York is preparing to take off. A male flight attendant notices a group of 50 wealthy Orthodox Jews board the plane and take their seats in first class. He thinks to himself ""if I cater to their every whim, they each will give a $10 tip and I will be $500 richer."" So throughout the flight he does whatever they ask him to do and more. He goes back and forth bringing wine, food, pillows, toilet paper, books, magazines, etc. and asks if they need anything else. When the plane finally lands in New York and the passengers begin to disembark, the first Jew in the group walks up to him and shakes his hand and says,

""This was the best service I have ever received. Thank you and God bless you."" 

He then gathers up his belongings and leaves the plane. The second person does the same thing and so do all others. The flight attendant is absolutely livid. Finally, the last Jew in the group walks up to him and says.

""We have all been very impressed with your wonderful service. So to show our gratitude, on behalf of everyone in my group, I present a check for $5,000."" 

He then hands him the check and leaves. As the flight attendant watches the group go to the airport building he says, 

""Oh, you Jews, maybe you didn't kill Jesus, but you've definitely tortured his soul.""",NSFW

One nun states that she doesn't want to get paint on her habit so she thinks she should take it off. The other nuns agree that they don't want to get paint on their habits either so the three of them decide that it would be okay to take them off as it's only the three of them inside the convent and nobody else will see them naked.

The nuns continue painting, in the nude, when they hear a knock on the door.

""Who is it?""

""It's the blind man.""

The nuns talk amongst themselves and decide that since the man at the door is blind, maybe it would be okay to answer the door without having to put their habits back on since he won't be able to see anything anyways. So one nun goes to answer the door.

The door is opened and the blind man says, ""nice tits, now where do you want me to put these blinds?""",NSFW

"Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Dam, and Arnold Schwarzenegger So one day, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Dam, and Arnold Schwarzenegger were sitting together in a bar, kicking back, drinking a few brews, talking about life and talking about the roles they'd played in movies.

As the three men talked, each was surprised to realize that all three of them had grown tired of playing the action hero- shooting the bad guys, pulling off life-threatening stunts, and getting the girl in the end.  The whole scene was just all played out for them.

By chance, Stallone had with him a script that his agent had given to him kind of as a joke.  The script would allow three actors to act out the role of their favorite musical composer.  The three men were delighted, ""This is great! Nobody would ever expect this from us! Let's do it!""  And so the agreement was made. Soon, a big budget studio was attached to the project, Spielberg signed on to direct, everything was falling into place.

On the day of the first pre-production meeting, the actors realized they needed to pick parts. Since Stallone had proposed the idea, he got to choose first.  After thinking for a minute, he declared ""I want to be Beethoven."" The others agreed to let Stallone have Beethoven.

Next, it was Van Dam's turn.  He thought for a moment, then declared, ""I want to play Mozart."" And the others agreed to that as well.

Finally, it was Arnold Schwarzenegger's turn.  After thinking about it for several moments, Schwarzenegger finally declared, *cue Terminator voice*: ""I'll be Bach.""",NSFW

He decides that the great outdoors is calling him anyway, so it doesn't really bother him. he decides to throw caution to the wind and become a lumberjack despite knowing nothing about the profession. Because of this he sets off to get some practice chopping trees down.

He walks into the local hardware store and asks for gloves, a saw and a hardhat. The store clerk sets him up with a chainsaw, gloves and a hard hat and sets him on his way.

The next day the new lumberjack comes back covered in dirt, sweating and weathered from his first day of lumberjacking. The clerk asks him, ""How many trees did you fall?""

The new lumberjack says ""NONE! This saw is faulty, I've been trying all day and it doesn't even leave a mark in the trees, I've tried it on pine, maple, doug fir and all the same result, it HAS to be the saw.""

The clerk takes a look at the saw and asks, ""Did you put oil in it?""

""Yes I did,"" says the lumberjack, ""it just doesn't cut like I said""

How she took the house and the kids (she could have them), half his money but she couldn't touch his baby- a supped up Camaro.  He said that Camaro was about the fastest thing in the world.

The snail is getting pretty fed up and just wants some peace and quiet.  He turns to the fox and says ""I'll make you a bet.  I challenge you to a race tomorrow at noon.  If I win, You don't ever come back in here""

The snail replies that if the fox wins the snail will buy his beer for a year.

There was such a large range of aliens that the area manager decided naming the aliens would be a necessity, however the aliens only liked one name: ""AL"".

The original AL was the being in charge and he'd manage the aliens and appoint them their jobs and recently they'd had a problem they couldn't find an alien that could successfully decide on advanced war decisions, since the extraterrestrials were so much more advanced the government had them decide on such things.

The original AL thought that perhaps their species didn't have what it takes to make those kind of decisions a certain key element that humans have but they don't, but then he remembered a special fellow and he decided to present him to the government as the new decision master.

At the presentation Big AL set up the chairs and Coffee AL set up the drinks and AL took the chosen AL and set him in front of the humans, they asked him ""what does he have that the rest of the extraterrestrials don't?""

Man: I can't get drunk like I used to, my wife would kill me.

Friend: Aww come on.  It will be just like old times.  Let's have a few beers.

After a few hours the man gets so drunk that he vomits all over himself.

Man: See, I told you I shouldn't drink.  My wife is going to kill me!

Friend: don't worry about it, you can blame it on me.  I'll put a $10 bill in your shirt pocket and if your wife asks it's because I puked on you.

Later that night the man stumbles into his house and is confronted by his wife.

Wife: oh look at this, I knew you would get too drunk with your friend!  You puked all over yourself!

Man: (heavily slurring his words) no no no, look see my friend puked on me.  Look he gave me $10 it's in my pocket.

"the best way A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up 

So, he opens the box and picks up the letter. He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

‚ÄúPardon me, sir,‚Äù the mailman says, ‚Äúbut you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it‚Äôs only going to end up back at your home in a few days.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again‚Äù replies the Buddhist monk.

‚ÄúBut sir,‚Äù says mailman, ‚Äúyou will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.‚Äù

The priest pondered this, and said ""if you can go ring the bell at 3, you can have the job.""

So right at three he went up the stairs to the massive Bell;m, rand and slammed his entire face into the bell, ringing it once. He backed up, and ran into the bell with his face again, ringing it once more.

"The Founding Father‚Äôs Were Potheads (Part. 1) [on going research] This ain‚Äôt a joke.

Hear me out, I‚Äôm on to something, trust me. 

1st of all fuck what historical facts you have heard, I did intensive research on the revolution and these are the conclusions I came up with. You can believe me or not.

Many saw the Seven Year‚Äôs War (French and Indian War) as the unofficial beginning of the American Revolution. You may ask yourself, why did the War start and by who? Well a great ‚Äúland surveyor‚Äù (hemp grower) George Washington, you may have heard of him, brought it upon himself to gather a militia and attack French forts in the Ohio River Valley. Why did he do that? Simple, withdrawal. Those damn French were stealing his hemp! So he gathered his boys and head out to get his hemp back. Little did he know the French smoked it all, so he went apeshit and attacked forts. He didn‚Äôt expect it to escalate into a war...

Fast forward after the war, the proclamation of 1763 was put on the colonies preventing them from settling west. You know damn well Washington and his boys didn‚Äôt give a fuck about that. At that time 90% of American crop production was hemp. Around this time Washington became close to his boys Franklin, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, and Jay. Their favorite activity was puff-puff-pass, which they did every week on boys night out. Anyways, the British started taxing the fuck out of the colonies on Tea, paper, etc... Nobody GAVE A FUCK. The British often gave hemp production write offs anyways. Everything you hear about colonial resistance is a lie. The Boston Massacre was over some hippies protesting the cutting down of an ancient tree. Americans didn‚Äôt give a fuck about no politics, fuck you mean?

Now here comes December 16th, 1773. The squad (close-knit group of founding fathers) gathered for their weekly boys night out, but it was a costume party this time around. As you can probably guess, they all dressed up as Indians in honor of the late homie Pontiac the chief (rip). Well, I‚Äôm guessing someone accidentally brought synthetic shit and the squad started tripping out. Fast forward, they passed the Boston port and thought there was no water in the sea. In an act of desperation, they took tons of tea and dumped it in the sea, to save the fish homies. Britain didn‚Äôt like that. In result, the British started taking the colonists‚Äô hemp...

Mass panic spread across the colonies. People started hiding their weed anywhere they could. This is a violation of human rights! Horrible! Mass unity of the colonies due to hemp occurred. The squad got back together again in Continental Congresses to discuss plans of secession...

The normal belief that TJ, BJ, and JM wrote the Declaration of Independence is completely wrong. John Jay wrote it but nobody cares about him. Anyways, at the bottom Jay wrote down the freedom of all slaves in the states because they knew they needed the blacks to fight against the British soldiers, mostly because the blacks were sober primarily and high whites with guns didn‚Äôt sound good. At the commencement of the meeting, everyone left but George Washington, he was taking his post-high nap. A literate slave caught a glance at the paper and saw the abolition of slavery, so he hollered in joy. Washington woke and scolded the kid for yelling and told him to pass the hemp paper (the Declaration of Independence!). The slave was hesitant, but wouldn‚Äôt disobey his master (quite sad). Washington rolled the fattest blunt possible with the paper and smoke that shit. The slave shared the blunt with Washington in sorrow. Washington didn‚Äôt know he was burning the Declaration of Independence, smh. Before he burnt the whole damn thing, Franklin came back to pick up the document and caught Washington in the process. That‚Äôs why slavery was still legal omg smh.

As he got older they would put him in front of the window and he would watch the other kids run and play in the park across the street. One day a doctor rocked up with radical plan for a whole body transplant and after much thought the family decided to give it a go. Months of surgeries, healing and rehab ensued but finally the little boy had a complete body and was allowed to go home. His very first request was to go and play with the kids in the park across the street and of course his loving parents agreed happily. As he joyfully ran with his new body to finally get to do what he'd always longed to, he was hit by a speeding car and killed. The moral of this story is, sometimes, you should quit while you're a head.",NSFW

"Old Piano Player  A gray-headed old man shuffled into a downtown bar holding his head up high.

""I'd like to apply for the job,"" he said. ‚ÄúI was a Navy F-4 pilot off the USS Coral Sea. I learned to play the piano at Officers' Club happy hours while in port, so here I am."" 
 
The barkeep wasn't too sure about this doubtful looking old guy, but it had been quite a while since he had a piano player and business was falling off.  So, why not give him a try. 
  
The old pilot shuffled his way over to the piano while several patrons snickered. By the time he was into his third bar of music, every voice was silenced. What followed was a rhapsody of soaring music unlike anything heard in the bar before. When he finished there wasn't a dry eye in the place. 
  
The bartender took the old Navy pilot a beer and asked him the name of the song he had just played.  It's called ""Drop your Skivvies, Baby, I'm Going Balls To The Wall For You"" he said.  After a long pull from the beer, leaving it empty, he said ""I wrote it myself."" 
  
The bartender and the crowd winced at the title, but the piano player just went on into a knee-slapping, hand-clapping bit of ragtime that had the place jumping.  After he finished, the F-4 pilot acknowledged the applause, downed a second offered mug, and told the crowd the song was called, ""Big Boobs Make My Afterburner Light.""

"The haunted room There was a beautiful hotel out in some distant little town that had acquired quite the reputation over the years.

When the old owners passed away and some new people bought the place. They started hearing stories from their customers of odd noises coming from room 1313. 

One night a customer staying in the room around midnight Is awoken by a voice

""If I catch you! I'm gonna eat you!""

The man pulls the covers over his face "" I must be hallucinating""

The voice comes again "" IF...I catch..You. I'm gonna eat you!""

The man starts to panic and jumps out of the bed and heads for the door but the voice comes from that direction once more

""If I catch you. I'm gonna eat you."" 

The man scared witless opts to turn and without thought jumps out the window. Plummeting 13 floors to his death!

The event is investigated and nothing irregular is ever found in the hotel room and there are no signs of someone else being in there or pushing the man out.

So after sometime passes business continues regularly... for a while.
One evening a female customer rents room 1313. 

The owner warns of its previous renters fate.

The women not superstitious and that being the last room available in the area coincidentally, stays there through her own volition, although would have also been forced to stay there.

When midnight comes around and the women is sleeping. The voice comes to life

""IF...I....Ca-atch you... I... I'm gonna eat...you!""

The women wakes up immediately.

""IF I catch you! Im gonna eat you!"" 

The women panics and heads for the door.  The voice coming from near the door again says

""if I catch you im gonna eat you!""

Scared witless like our last customer the woman panics and opts to exit out the window also and plummets thirteen floors to her death.

Witnessing the event the owner decides to investigate the room while the authorities are on the way.

When he enters room 1313 he hears ""if I catch you im gonna eat you"" clearly coming frommthe closet beside the entrance.

He opens it and finds his five year old son sitting in the closet picking his nose and with his struggle he says

"Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Northwestern University .  
On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. 

He got down on one knee and inspected the elephant's foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his hunting knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day. 

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man. 

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter couldn't help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peters legs and slammed his stupid ass against the railing, killing him instantly. 

Probably wasn't the same elephant.

As I sat at my desk waiting for my first-ever customer, an old man walked in with a Labrador Retriever by his side. The man sauntered up to my desk, and in a thick British accent said to me, ""I've got two loans currently taken, both of which I'd like to repay. You can find me under Wyman, Bill.

Before I could look him up, he rustled in his coat pocket and removed a pack orange-flavored Tic-Tac breath mints. Without missing a beat, he took one, said, ""You should find this sufficient to cover the first balance,"" and kneeled down to set it on my foot.

""And _this_,"" he held up another, ""should cover the second."" Again, he kneeled down and set it on my foot. At this point I had no idea how to react to this guy, but it was at that moment things entered a whole dimension of weird.

The dog placed its paws on my desk and this guy says, ""Oh yes, and the dog needs to take out a loan for $100,000. I understand this is an exceptional request, so I shall present you with this..."" Once more he began fishing through his pockets, this time revealing a small trinket of no discernable value. ""Present this to your boss, he'll know what it means.""

So I made my way to the back and knocked on the door of the branch manager's suite. After he invited me in, I recounted to him all of the events that had taken place up to this point. I showed him the strange object and said, ""He wanted you to see this. Said you'd know what it means. What even is this thing?""

He took it from me and examined it inquisitively. His brow furrowed, ""This old man, he payed two?"" 

""He placed Tic-Tacs on my shoe,"" I corrected. And with that, his eyes grew enormous as he exclaimed, ""It's a knick-knack, Patty Mack! Give the dog a loan; this old man's a Rolling Stone!",SFW

The sun is shining, it's a warm day in early summer, and a couple who recently met on Tinder are riding their bicycles through the countryside. They are both attracted to each other, looking athletic in cycling gear, and getting a buzz out of the sexual tension, the sensation of speed, and the liberating feeling of being out in the open. 

The girl, being the experienced cyclist, is riding more slowly, and the guy is doing his best not to show off. He follows his date at an equally sedate pace. 

They just finished climbing a hill and are starting to coast downhill when the girl suddenly yelps, and starts hawking violently, coughing and spitting, almost falling off her bike. The guy, startled by the sudden transformation of his date from a cool, sexy girl into a spittle spewing monster, asks, ""Hey, are you OK? What happened?""

Still coughing and spitting, with tears rolling down her cheeks now, the girl replies, ""I swallowed a fly! It flew right in my mouth!""

Surprised by her overreaction, the guy starts to suggest that the girl drink some water, when all of a sudden she gets back on her bike, and sprints off at top speed. He quickly follows but is amazed at how fast she is going and actually has a hard time catching up. 

He finally is neck and neck with her, and starts yelling about how swallowing a fly never hurt anybody, when all of a sudden she veers off into a gas station, dumps her bike, runs into the store, and starts stuffing hot dogs and chicken wings into her mouth, before even paying for them. 

Inwardly freaked out by this bizarre behavior, the guy tries hard to maintain composure, and asks her what she is doing.

"A cowboy rode into town and stopped at a saloon for a drink. Unfortunately, the locals always had a habit of picking on strangers, which he was. When he finished his drink, he found his horse had been stolen. He went back into the bar, handily flipped his gun into the air, caught it above his head without even looking and fired a shot into the ceiling.  

""Which one of you sidewinders stole my horse?!"" he yelled with surprising forcefulness. No one answered.  

""Alright, I'm gonna have another beer, and if my horse ain't back outside by the time I finish, I'm gonna do what I dun in Texas! And I don't like to have to do what I dun in Texas!"" 

Some of the locals shifted restlessly.  The man, true to his word, had another beer, walked outside, and his horse has been returned to the post.  He saddled up and started to ride out of town. The bartender wandered out of the bar and asked, ""Say partner, before you go... what happened in Texas?"" The cowboy turned back and said, ""I had to walk home.""",NSFW

"Juan Joke (Really Long) There's a man named Juan. He's a good man, he doesn't beat his wife, doesn't beat his kids, doesn't beat the armadillo in his yard, he's kind to his neighbours and he takes care of his mother. He goes to work one day and his boss says,  ""Juan, I know that you're a good man, you don't beat your wife, you don't beat your kids, you don't beat the armadillo in your yard, you're kind to your neighbours and you take care of your mother. I'm giving you a promotion.""

Juan replies ""No sir, I couldn't, is there anyone else you could choose?""

""No Juan, it must be you. It's for the good of the company.""

""Fine, if it's for the good of the company, I guess I must.""

So Juan accepts the promotion and is working in his new job. A year later, his boss comes up to him and says ""Juan, you're a good man, you don't beat your wife, you don't beat your kids, you don't beat the armadillo in your yard, you're kind to your neighbours and you take care of your mother. I'm retiring and I want you to take my place.""

""Really, is there anyone else you could choose?"" Juan asks.

""No Juan, it must be you. It's for the good of the company.""

""Well, if it's for the good of the company, I guess I have no choice.""

So Juan, now owning the company, carries on with his day-to-day life. Three years later, it's election day and everybody has heard of Juan. Everyone in the country wants Juan to be the president. Juan is taken aback and asks everyone ""Do you have to vote for me, is there another way?""

One man says ""No Juan, everybody knows you, you don't beat your wife, you don't beat your kids, you don't beat the armadillo in your yard, you're kind to your neighbours and you take care of your mother, you have to lead our country. Its for the good of the country""

""Oh, well if it's for the good of the country, I guess I must.""

Two years later, Juan is a household name, everybody knows who he is, and all of the world wants Juan to lead them, so they nominate him to lead the Earth. The current presidents/prime ministers all agree that Juan is ""a good man that doesn't beat his wife, doesn't beat his kids, doesn't beat the armadillo in his yard, he's kind to his neighbours and he takes care of his mother.""

""Really, me? Can it be anyone else?""

""No, it must be you, after all, it is for the good of the world"". Everyone agrees.

""Fine, if the fate of the world depends on it, I guess I don't have a choice"". 

So Juan, now the president, very rich, very famous, is sitting at home with his family, when a man knocks on his door. Juan  opens the door and the man proclaims ""Juan... you've ruined my life.""

""Oh my God, I'm so sorry, what have I done? Is there anything I can do?""

The man ignores Juan's questions and gives him a choice, to make him happy and step down from his position as the leader of the world, or continue on and make his life more miserable. He gives Juan until the next day to finalise his answer.

Juan gives this a lot of thought. The entire world is happy with him and what a great job he is doing, while one man doesn't like what he is doing. Juan goes to sleep, thinking hard about the ultimatum. The next day, the same man knocks on his door and asks for his response. Juan tells him ""the entire world of more that 8 billion wants me to remain in my position, so that's what I'm going to do.""

""Fine"" the man says and walks away.

During the night, Juan wakes up to the same man standing in his bedroom with a gun. The man speaks softly, ""Juan, I'm sorry I have to do this, I know you're a good man, you don't beat your wife, you don't beat your kids, you don't beat the armadillo in your yard, you're kind to your neighbours and you take care of your mother, but I have to do this"" and he shoots Juan.

But this is a special type of gun. It is a golf gun. So the man put a Hole-In-Juan.",NSFW

She complained about how much effort it took to plant, water, and grow the vegetables. So the old farmer built the strongest dam, and used canals to irrigate the farmland. He built magnificent bridges by hand, and dedicated them all to his wife. While he was working, the wife planned to release the dam and wash the old farmer away. 

She broke the dam, flooded the valley, and it washed away the entire farm. Unfortunately for her, she was swept away by the rush of the water, along with the house, barn, and all of the animals too. All that remained was the old farmer, who watched from atop a bridge, while his entire livelihood trickled down the river into the horizon.

A reporter was on the scene shortly after, to ask the old farmer about what happened. The reporter asked how the old farmer felt knowing his wife tried killing him and, inadvertently, washing away everything he‚Äôd known and loved.

The old farmer simply replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all water under the bridge‚Äù",NSFW

"There was a race against time on who can make a more aggressive dog... The Israelis and Arabs finally realized that the continuation of the battle could lead to the destruction of the whole world. Therefore, they decided once to stop the carnage and solve the dispute in an ancient way: a duel! As between David and Goliath. And this ""duel"" should be a dog fight ...
The mediators agreed that each party is given 5 years to grow the best fighting dog that they can. The dog that wins will deserve for its people the right to lead on this disputed land. And the losing side will have to lay down arms in an amicable way.

The Arabs found the largest Dobermans and Rottweilers in the world. They crossed them, and then crossed their puppies with the worst Siberian wolves. They chose only the largest and most powerful puppy of all litters, fed it with the best food, used steroids and found the best trainers to create the best ""killing machine"".

5 years later. The Arabs had a dog that needed steel prison bars for the cage! Only an expert coach could handle this extremely terrible and ferocious monster.
When the day of the big dog fight came, the Israelis appeared with a very strange looking animal. It was a terribly disproportionate dachshund, 3 meters long!

Every spectator in the arena felt pity for the Israelis. Nobody seriously thought that this strange, incomprehensible animal has at least one chance to stand against the snarling monster sitting on the chain in the Arab camp. All totes predicted that the Arabian dog would defeat Israel in a matter of seconds.

When the cells were opened, the dachshund slowly hobbled to the center of the circle. The Arabian dog jumped out of the cage and, splashing saliva, rushed to the giant strange dog of the Israelis. When the Arabian dog was in inches from the Israeli dog, the dachshund opened its mouth and ... swallowed the Arab monster in one sitting! Nothing left, well, maybe, except for a tiny scrap of wool from the tail of an Arab dog ...

The dumbfounded crowd of international observers, brokers and journalists published a general cry of unbelief and surprise. Everyone was confused.

The Arabs approached the Israelites, muttering and shaking their heads, stricken. ""We do not understand,"" said their leader. ""Our best scientists worked without rest for 5 years, crossed the worst, the largest Dobermans and Rottweilers with Siberian wolves, brought an incredible"" killing machine ""from the dog! .. But how?!. .. ""

The old man answered, ""This is my property yer crossin into, and I'm tellin you, yer not coming over."" 

The indignant attorney said, ""I'll have you know that I'm one of the best solicitors in all of Ireland, and if you don't let me retrieve my bird, I'll take ye to court for everything y'own!"" 

The old farmer looked him over and said, ""Well now, being as how you're not from around here, you don't know how we settle things like this. Y'see now, here we use the three-kick method."" 

""And what would that be?"", asked the lawyer. The farmer said, ""First I kick you three times and then you do the same to me, and back and forth like that till one or the other gives up."" 

The attorney thought this over, and quickly decided he could easily take the old codger, and agreed to the local custom. The old farmer walked slowly over to the lawyer. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy boot in the solicitor's groin dropping him to his knees. The second blow nearly wiped the lawyers nose off his face. The attorney was flat on the ground when the farmer's third kick to the kidney almost finished him.

Outraged the DJ started a campaign on the air telling his listeners what was going on. That The Beach Boys wanted to charge the station an outrageous amount of money to play their old music.

"A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass he asked the monsignor for help. The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervious I take a sip."" So the next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon return to his office after mass he found the following note on his door:

Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.

We do not refer to the cross as the Big T!

When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, ""Take this and eat it, for it is my body"", he did not say, ""Eat me.""

The Virgin Mary is not referred to as the, ""Mary with the Cherry"".

The recommended grace before a meal is not: ""Rub-A-dub-dub, thanks for the grub, yeah God""

"A tourist is visiting New York city for the first time A tourist is visiting New York city for the first time and has come to the observation deck of the Empire State Building, replete with a bar. It must have been a Tuesday because the only other people there were the bartender and a stranger who was drinking quite heavily at the bar.

After taking in the view and snapping some photographs the tourist orders a drink from the bartender and engages the stranger in small talk.

Eventually the stranger turns to the tourist and says ""You know, last week I discovered that if you jump from the top of this building, by the time you fall to the 10th floor, the winds around the building are so intense that they carry you around the building and back into the window.""

Hearing this, the bartender just shakes his head disapprovingly while continuing to clean a glass.

The tourist responds, ""What, are you nuts!? there is no way that is true!"" 

The Stranger says ""No, seriously it is absolutely true, and I'll prove it to you!"" He gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and plummets towards the street below. When he passes the 10th floor, the high wind whips him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar. He meets the Tourist, who looks quite astonished.

""You know, I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke,"" says the tourist. 

""No, I'll prove it again,"" says the stranger as he jumps over once more. Again just as he is hurtling toward the street, the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window.

Once the stranger get's upstairs again the tourist is adamant that he must try this once in a lifetime experience for himself and insists that the stranger takes his camera to capture the event for his friends back home. The stranger agrees, and the tourist flings himself over the balcony! He rushes past the 12th floor, 11th, 10th...... 9th, 8th floors..... and hits the pavement with a huuuuge splat!

Back upstairs the bartender turns to the stranger and says: ""You know what Superman, you are a real asshole when you're drunk!""",NSFW

"A priest and a rabbi are invited to a bachelor party... which beginning at strip club, would follow to a casino before ending with cheap drinks at a bar. Although initially hesitant the two holy men gave it a chance. 

At the first strip club the bachelors group is stopped from entering, with the explanation that they cannot go in if the priest and the rabbi are with them.

 The leave but the best man has an idea that the bouncer must think it‚Äôs a bit disturbing if two men in holy vestments enter strip bar ‚Ä¶ so maybe if they changed out of said vestments maybe they will be let in. So the holy men change, and yet still they are stopped at the door with the bouncer explaining that there is no use hiding and that they can‚Äôt go in. 

So the group go with their back up plan, but sure enough the group is stopped at the door, with a firm rejection explaining that they can‚Äôt come in if the holy men follow. Upon leaving they are given a further explanation that no peep show to brothel will serve them as long as the two holy men are in their party.

 At this point the groom makes a comment that it must be Gods will that prevents them from entering these places. 

The priest chimes in that he doubts this as just a week ago God was perfectly fine in letting him and rabbi go place to place ‚Ä¶
 
The best man asks them what they did to get such response from all of these establishments.

The rabbi explains that last week they went place to place, providing lectures on Old Testament and the bible to the employees of these establishments, in attempt to get the girls out of these houses of ill repute and back on the path of rightness and God.

Best man then reasons that maybe if they made promise to not lecture at the door they will get a chance to get in.

To which the priest replies that they better get pretty drunk at the bar first as their lectures didn‚Äôt work on the ugly ones.

"Obama was scheduled to visit a Catholic church... An aide to President Barack Obama visited the Cardinal of the Catholic cathedral in Washington.  He told the Cardinal that President Barack Obama would be attending the next mass, and he asked if the Cardinal would kindly point out Obama to the congregation and say a few words that would include calling Obama a saint.
 
The Cardinal replied, ""No. I don't really like the man, and there are issues of conflict with the Catholic Church over certain of Obama's views.  Obama's aide then said, ""Look, I'll write a check here and now for a donation of $10,000 to your church if you'll just tell the congregation you see Obama as a saint."" The Cardinal thought about it and said, ""Well, the church can use the money, so I'll work your request into tomorrow's sermon.""
 
As Obama's aide promised, Obama appeared for the Sunday worship and seated himself prominently at the forward left side of the center aisle. As promised, at the start of his sermon, the Cardinal pointed out that Obama was present. The Cardinal went on to explain to the congregation, ""While President Obama‚Äôs presence is probably an honor to some, the man is not numbered among my personal favorite personages. Some of his views are contrary to tenets of the Church, and he tends to flip-flop on many other issues. Barack Obama is a petty, self-absorbed hypocrite, a thumb sucker and a nit-wit. Barack Obama is also a serial liar, a cheat, and a thief. I must say, Barack Obama is the worst example of a Christian I have ever personally witnessed. He is a narcissist and is using his speaking ability to lie to the American people. He also has a reputation for shirking his obligations, both In Washington and in Illinois. The man is simply not to be trusted.""
 
The Cardinal concluded, ""But, when compared with Hillary Clinton, Obama is a Saint.""",NSFW

After a few minutes, the doctor comes out and asks her assistant for a wrench, which understandably concerns the husband.

Then, after a couple more moments, the doctor re-enters the room, this time asking for a screwdriver. The husband grows worried and begins to pace in circles.

Then, a little later, the doctor bursts through the doors screaming for a hammer and at that, the husband, in a state of frenzied fear, runs up and asks, ""Doctor, what the heck is wrong with my wife?""

"Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao, and Ling were getting lazy sitting around after defeating the Huns \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In case it's been a while since you've seen Disney's Animated Mulan:

Mulan - Daughter of a war veteran  who steals her father's armor and takes his place in the army as a boy named Ping

General Shang - Captain of a squadron of new recruits

Chien-Po - A new recruit in the army. Tall, Fat, loves food

Yao - A new recruit in the army. Short, Short-tempered, short on brain cells

Ling - A new recruit in the army. Medium height, skinny, likes jokes.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao, and Ling were getting lazy sitting around after defeating the Huns. So General Shang decided to throw them back into training camp. But this time he sent them on quests around the world.  

Yao proposed that they should make all his challenges into a competition and whoever wins the most gets to sit next to the emperor at the next Chinese New Year's celebration.   

First, they had to retrieve an arrow from the top of a giant Sequoia tree in California while carrying heavy amulets. Much like the original training camp Mulan's ingenuity allowed her to win that challenge.  

To be as swift as a coursing river they had to swim across the Amazon river. Ling with his streamlined body slithered to first.   

To have the force of a great typhoon. They had to protect a house in a Phillipino village for the month of August. While most of them ran around being buffeted by the winds. Chien-Po literally just sat in front of his house and all flying objects bounced off him. Earning him a victory.  

To have the strength of a raging fire they tight roped across the Sakurajima volcano in Japan. Yao was angry at this point and fireballed across the rope (literally he may have gotten singed but he finally had a win under his belt).  

With one win each, they entered the final challenge. Mysterious as the dark side of the moon. They had to go to Antarctica and disappear into the wildlife.  

 Ling painted a box white and hid inside it.  

Yao covered himself in white furs and lumbered around on all fours.  

Chien-Po flopped around on the beach.  

Mulan changed into her father's armor, sliced her hair off again and marched deep into the heart of Antarctica.   

General Shang arrived to judge who fulfilled the task best.  As soon as he stepped off the boat he saw a shivering 6'tall cardboard box.   

""Ling! That is the lowest effort ice block there is! Eliminated!!""  

Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a bear chomping on some fish.  

""Yao! There are no polar bears in Antarctica! Disqualified!"" 

When the leopard seals slid into the icy waters. They left behind someone with blubber - but not quite enough.  

""Chien-Po solid effort but you still missed the mark!""  

Next, they followed footprints into the heart of Antarctica until they reached an Emperor colony. At the heart stood a male figure 2 feet taller than the birds. 

""Mulan! You're clearly not blending into those puffins!! You lose! "" 

""No. Ping win.""",NSFW

"Three Aliens are discussing the fate of earth. After a successful invasion of earth, the leaders of the armada joined together to discuss the ruling of the planet. Each of the leaders had a different idea on how what they should do with the surviving humans.

""These humans are dangerous,"" said the first. ""We all know the losses we took to subjugate them. We need to kill the rest before they kill more of us!""

""Our losses are precisely why we can't kill them all,"" said the second. ""The cost of this invasion was more than any of us could have predicted! We need to enslave them! Have them harvest their own planet for us so we can recoup our losses.""

Yet a third had another idea. ""We could transport them back home and sell them to the zoos! People would pay dearly to see these them"".

The first two vetoed the third. Shipping that number of people half way across the galaxy was too much, they must stay where they were, dead or alive.

This went on for several months with neither of the three able to convince the two. A compromise was finally reached - the humans would be enslaved, but public executions would take place first, to keep them in line. Some few would be taken home and sold to the zoos.

The alien leaders flew down to earth and arrived at the first of the compounds where the humans were being kept. They announced their plan to enslave the humans. As was expected, there was anger from the crowd. Several started shouting and making obscene gestures. Those were pointed out to the alien guards and brought to the front were they were executed in the most horrific way.

They flew to another camp and the process was repeated. Several humans raised their hands and haves them in obscene ways and those were executed, the rest enslaved.

They visited several camps and finally reached the last one, their task almost complete. They announced the plan one last time and again the humans raised their hands in anger. The alien leaders pointed them out one at a time.

"Ten Simple Rules for Dating My Daughter Rule One:

If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a package, because you're sure not picking anything up.


Rule Two:

You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.


Rule Three:

I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose his compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, in order to ensure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place to your waist.


Rule Four:

I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a ""barrier method"" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate, when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.


Rule Five:

It is usually understood that in order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is ""early.""


Rule Six:

I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make you cry.


Rule Seven:

As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process that can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?


Rule Eight:

The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka - zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which features chain saws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.

Rule Nine:

Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a potbellied, balding, middle-aged, dimwitted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless god of your universe. If I ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle with me.

Rule Ten:

Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy near Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveway you should exit your car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your car - there is no need for you to come inside. The camouflaged face at the window is mine.",NSFW

"A man is driving down the carpool lane on the 101 with a strapped into the passenger seat of his truck. A CHP officer pulls him over, looks him up and down.  Nothing strange there.  Looks the penguin up and down.  Yup, it's certainly a penguin.  The man in the truck says ""excuse me officer, have I done something wrong.""

Taking the man for a fool the policeman says ""I'm not going to write you a ticket, as long as you promise me you'll take that penguin to the Zoo.""

The truck putters off and the officer heads back to the office.

The next week on the same stretch of the 101, the same officer sees the same old blue Chevy in the carpool lane. The siren blares and they park in the same pull out.  The officer looks the man up and down.  Yep, same man.  He looks the passenger up and down.  Yup.  Same penguin.

""I told you last week that I wanted to take that penguin to the Zoo."" The driver squirms in his seat and says ""I'm sorry officer.  With my parents coming into town and all I just plum forgot.""

The officer, who doesn't really want to file a report about a penguin anyway, says ""alright.  But I don't want you to see you in the carpool lane again. And by God, if you don't take that penguin to the Zoo..."". He stops, but the threat is clear.

About a week later, along the same stretch of the 101 the same officer sees the same blue beater stuck in traffic. 

He watches as it doesn't move, he feels some satisfaction at a job well down.

He watches it just a little more and just there in the front seat he sees the man drop an anchovy on the passenger seat and just the very tip of a yellow beak.  That's fucking it.

He pulls that asshole over and doesn't even wait until the man rolls down his window.  He radios the HQ and asks for every known law about this owning and transporting a penguin. "" Two weeks now I've pulled you over and for two goddamn weeks of I've told you to.take this animal to the zoo.  Now, I can't ignore this anymore.  If you won't take this creatures to the Zoo, then I will!""

The officer looks at the penguin and notices the towel and sunglasses.

""But officer,. We did go to the Zoo.  This week I promised we would go to the beach.""",NSFW

"For several years, a man was having an affair 
with an Italian woman. One night, she confided in him that she was pregnant.
Not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he paid her a large sum of money if she would go to Italy to secretly have the child.
If she stayed in Italy to raise the child, he would also provide child support until the child turned 18. She tearfully agreed, but asked how to let him know when the baby was born.
To keep it discreet, he told her to simply mail him a postcard, and write ‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù on the back. He would then arrange for the child support payments to begin.
One day, about nine months later, he came home to his confused wife. ‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúyou received a very strange postcard today.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, just give it to me and I‚Äôll explain it later,‚Äù he said.

"The Safari Jimmy was an 8-year-old boy who loved animals. He longed to go to a wildlife reserve and experience nature up-close-and-personal. His parents, eager to instill moral values, were delighted that this was the case instead of playing violent video games. So, on his ninth birthday, Jimmy was ecstatic to hear that his parents were taking him on a safari! 

On the day before he was due to leave, Jimmy had a playdate with his friends. When their parents came to pick them up, Jimmy's mother wanted to boast about her son's hobby.

""Jimmy,"" she called, ""Come and tell your friend's mother where you're going tomorrow.""

Jimmy came running into the foyer. With a grin, he yelled, ""We're goin' on a frickin' safari!!!""

The parents, particularly Jimmy's, were horrified.

""Yeah, he's goin' on a frickin' safari!!"" his friend said to his mother, equally pleased.

'Where did you learn such language?"" one of the parents asked, to which a confused Jimmy replied, ""My parents!""

The friends were quickly escorted to their cars, with their parents scolding them. As they left, there were murmurs of ""such deplorable behavior"" and ""what awful parenting"". Jimmy's mother and father were dumbfounded. ""How could he do this?"" they asked. ""We've never said such words in our lives! Maybe we really are bad parents.""

The next day, on the flight to the preserve, Jimmy boarded the plane, eagerly singing, ""We're going on a frickin' safari!"" repeatedly. The mother and father looked at each other, and put their arms around Jimmy's shoulders. ""Listen, son,"" they said. ""Where did you really hear that word?""

""From you,"" he said, bewildered.

""Now, why would we ever say that?"" they insisted, to which their son replied, ""You told it to me on my birthday."" They sighed. ""Jimmy, look, whether we said it or not, that word is very inappropriate. We love you, and we don't want you getting in trouble.""

""Okay,"" Jimmy said. The rest of the flight was calm and quiet.

When they finally arrived, Jimmy rushed out of the plane. ""Yay!"" he exclaimed rushing toward the safari park, located near the airport. His parents ran to catch up with him, only to find on the front signpost~

So next weekend Jim has his first appointment at the clinic. He is welcomed by the doctor who sends him upstairs to the first floor for his first treatment."" In the parlor on the first floor, he finds a smoking hot 20-year old nurse with a great body and barely any clothes wearing. ""If you catch me, you may make love to me"", she says. Jim is stunned by this beauty and, eventually, after a long chase through the first floor, he catches her and they make love.

&amp;#x200B;

Excited by his success and the weight he lost, he talks to Phil. ""Well"", Phil says, ""if you like it so much, you should really try the advanced treatment on the second floor.""

So the next weekend, Jim makes an appointment with the doctor for the second floor. In the room on the second floor, he is greeted by an even hotter nurse, who is in incredibly good physical shape. ""If you catch me, you may make love to me"", she says.

After a long hunt through the second floor, Jim catches her, and they make love.

Jim is thrilled how well the treatment is going for him and talks to his buddy again. ""You know what"", Phil says, ""If you really want the best weight loss program then you must try the third floor.""

So the following weekend, Jim decides to book the treatment on the third floor. While going upwards with the elevator, Jim wonders what could possibly be even better than his last therapy session.

The woman started screaming, ""Oh my gosh, help me, there's a bee in my vagina!"" The husband immediately took her to the local doctor and explained the situation.
The doctor thought for a moment and said, ""Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit."" The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina.
The doctor said, ""OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. 
The husband nodded and gave his approval.
The young lady said, ""Yes, yes, whatever, just get on with it."" 
So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, ""I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper."" 
So the doctor went deeper and deeper... After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed... The young lady began to quiver with excitement. She began to moan and groan aloud... The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises.
The husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and shouted, ""Now wait a minute! What do you think you're doing?""

"Father Conor is walking by the Shannon when he sees one of his congregation fishing... He stops for a chat, and mentions that he's never fished before. 'It's a doddle,' says the angler. 'Take a rod and give it a go.'

'Well, I suppose the blessed Saint Peter himself was a fisherman. Perhaps I'll try my hand,' says the priest.

Father Conor sits down and casts his line. After a few minutes he gets a bite and reels in a fat ten-pounder. He's pleased as punch as his parishioner slaps him on the back and says, 'That's a great big fucker, Father!'

'Language!' replies Father Conor. 'I am a priest.'

'No, Father, this fish is called a fucker,' explains the angler, thinking on his feet.

Laughing at the misunderstanding, the proud priest takes his catch home and finds the bishop waiting in his front room.

'That's a splendid looking fish, Father,' exclaims the bishop.

'Aye,' replies the priest, 'it's a great fucker.'

'Please, Father! Such language,' says the bishop.¬†

'No, no, Your Grace,' replies the priest, 'fucker is the name of the fish.'

It being Friday, the reassured bishop suggests they repair to his residence for a fine fish supper. Once there the bishop goes to the kitchen to clean and gut the fish. They are then joined by the mother superior of the local convent. Being no great cook himself,¬†the bishop says, 'Reverend Mother, would you mind poaching this fucker for us?'

'Bishop, you cannot say that in the house of God,' gasps the horrified nun.

'You misunderstand, Reverend Mother,' explains the bishop, 'this fish is called a fucker.'

Calm again, the Mother Superior sets to cooking the fish. Shortly they are joined by the Pope, who is making a surprise visit (as he does). Delighted, the bishop invited him to supper.

They sit down at the table and the Pope says grace. Then the mother superior brings in the fish on the finest silver platter. Eagerly the three of them await the opinion of God's Mouthpiece on Earth.¬†

'That it is, Your Holiness. I caught the fucker,' says the beaming priest.

"The Pope had become very ill and was taken to many doctors... ..who were all quite skilled in the latest medical techniques. None of them could figure out how to cure him, or even what ailed him. 


Finally, a wise old physician was brought in. After an hour he came out and told the cardinals that the bad news was that the Pope had a difficult disorder of the testicles ---terminal blue balls. He said that the good news was that all the Pope had to do to be cured was to have sex a couple of times. 


Well, of course this was not good news to the cardinals, who argued about it at length. Finally they went to the Pope himself with the doctor and explained the situation. 


After some thought, the Pope stated, ""I reluctantly agree, but only under four very strict conditions."" 


The cardinals were amazed and there arose quite an uproar. Over all of the noise there came a single voice that asked, ""And what are the four conditions?"" The room immediately stilled. 


The Pope replied, ""First, the girl must be blind, so that she cannot see with whom she is having sex. Second, she must be deaf, so that she cannot hear with whom she is having sex. And third, she must be mute so that if she somehow figures it all out, she can tell no one.""

"The only cow in a small town in Ireland stopped giving milk....... Then the town folk found they could buy a cow in Wales for quite cheap. So, they brought the cow over from Wales . It was absolutely wonderful and it produced lots of milk every day and everyone was happy.

They later bought a bull to mate with the cow to get more cows, so they'd never have to worry about their milk supply again. They put the bull in the pasture with the cow but whenever the bull tried to mount the cow,
the cow would move away. No matter what approach the bull tried, the cow would move away from the bull and he was never able to do the deed.

The people were very upset and decided to go to
the local Vet, who was very wise, to tell him what was happening and ask his advice.

""Whenever the bull tries to mount our cow, she moves away. If he approaches from the back, she moves forward. When he approaches her from the front, she backs off. If he attempts it from the one side, she walks away to the other side"", told the people to the Vet.

The Vet rubbed his chin thoughtfully and pondered this
before asking, ""Did you by chance, buy this cow in Wales ?""

The people were dumbfounded, since no one had ever mentioned that they had brought the cow over from Wales. ""You are truly a wise Vet,"" they said. ""How did you know we got the cow from Wales ?

prominently on the center of the pillow.

It was addressed ""Dad"".
With the worst premonition,
he opened the envelope and
read the letter with trembling hands :-

Dear dad,

 It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you,
but I'm leaving home.

I had to elope with my new girlfriend Rosy because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.

I've been finding real passion with Rosy and she is so nice to me.

I know when you meet her you'll like her too even with all her piercings and tattoos.

But it's not only the passion Dad,
She is pregnant and said that
She wants to have the kid and
that we can be very happy together.

Even though Rosy is much older than me (anyway, 42 isn't so old these days is it?),
and has no money, really these things shouldn't stand in the way of our relationship, don't you agree?

It's true she had other boyfriends as well but I know she'll be faithful to me in her own way.

She wants to have many more children with me and that's now one of my dreams too.

In the meantime,
we'll pray that science will find a
cure for AIDS so Rosy can get better;
She sure deserves it!!

Your loving son,
Rocky.

"Classic joke for our Muslim friends today There were two white christian men, John and Mike, whose plane crashed into a desert. Luckily they survived unharmed. As they traveled through the hot desert looking for food and water, they gave up and sat down, thinking of what to do.

As the dust in the air settled, they suddenly could view a mosque ahead. They became very hopeful. But then John said ''Muslims are there. They might help us if we say we are Muslim.'' Then Mike said ''No way, I won't say I'm Muslim, I'm gonna be honest''.

So John and Mike went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.

John thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammad'. And Mike said 'My name is Mike'.

The Arab man said 'Hello Mike.' And told these other men to take Mike and give him food and drink.

Then he turned to John and said, 'Salaam Muhammad. Ramadan Mubarak! (Hello Muhammad, Happy Ramadan)

"Little Timmy always procrastinated his schoolwork A few weeks ago, his teacher assigned the class to write a 10,000 word paper on a great philosopher, but with just 12 hours until the paper was due, Little Timmy had not written a single word. Realizing his predicament, Little Timmy hastily took a pencil out of his drawer and sat down in front of blank paper to begin. 

Although he knew nothing about philosophy, he knew that if he wanted to finish in time, he'd have to start writing and hope that something would come to him as he did. Just as he was about to put pencil to paper... the great philosopher, Plato appeared in Little Timmy's bedroom!

Amazed, Little Timmy listened as stoic Plato started to speak. As philosophers do, Plato spoke at length about his views on the world and Little Timmy did his best to understand. At last, Plato said, ""Little Timmy, if you remember anything I've said, remember that for a man to conquer himself is the first and noblest of all victories!""

Head swimming, Little Timmy noticed that time had flown by and there were only 10 hours left to write his paper. 

Confident he could still finish in time, he grabbed his pencil to write down what Plato had said to him about man conquering himself. Just as he was about to put pencil to paper... the great philosopher, Descartes appeared in Little Timmy's bedroom!

Startled, Little Timmy listened as the contemplative Descartes started to speak. As philosophers do, Descartes spoke at length about his views on the world and once again, Little Timmy did his best to understand. At last, Descartes said, ""Little Timmy, if you remember anything I've said, remember this: I think, therefore I am!""

Still overwhelmed, Little Timmy noticed that more time had flown by and there were only 8 hours left to write his paper. 

Confident he could still finish in time, he grabbed his pencil to write down what Descartes had said to him about existence. Just as he was about to put pencil to paper... the great philosopher, Frederick Nietzsche appeared in Little Timmy's bedroom!

Unbelieving, Little Timmy listened as disparate Nietzsche started to speak. As philosophers do, Nietzsche spoke at length about his views on the world and Little Timmy did his best to understand. At last, Nietzsche said, ""Little Timmy, if you remember anything I've said, remember there is no point to anything.""

Deep in introspection, Little Timmy noticed that time had flown by and there were only 4 hours left to write his paper. Little Timmy began to sweat, he had never finished a paper in such little time, but Nietzsche had stuck a chord with him and he had finally decided that the hopeless philosopher would be the subject of the paper. 

Inspired and confident he could finish just in time, Little Timmy grabbed his pencil for the last time to write down what Nietzsche had said to him about there being no point to anything. However, just as he was about to put pencil to paper that final time...

Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ""Do these excite you?"" she asked.

"Three vampires sit in a cave in the black of night, sharing a drink, laughing, and generally having a good time that one would not associate with the undead. The night grew longer, and an observer, should they be careful enough, would learn that vampires can indeed get drunk.

Eventually, the three begin to bicker about which of them is the most powerful and deadly.

The youngest suddenly gets up, and flies off into the night. Almost instantly, he returns in a huge flock of bats. His hands are covered in blood.

With a cackle, he points down the road.

""You see that abandoned coach down there? I slaughtered everyone in it! The driver, a nobleman and his wife, their three sons, and a guardsman! All dead in the blink of an eye!""

The second, older than the first, but younger than the last, scoffs. ""Child's play. Watch this."" And disappears with the wind. Even with his heightened senses, the younger could not follow his movements.

The second vampire reappeared as suddenly as he had vanished, and the gust of his speed knocked the youngest to the ground. His hands, mouth, and collar were caked with gore. He gestures towards a town in the distance. As the vampires watched, a building lit on fire, and fell onto another one. Soon, the entire town was alight, but no movement could be seen from the townsfolk at all.

""A hundred people in that town! All dead! Torn to shreds!""

The youngest was in awe, but the eldest of the three only chuckled amusedly.

""How cute."" He says.

The second looks almost indignant. ""I'd like to see you do better.""

The third lets out a malevolent chuckle.

""Very well.""

He gets up, dusts off his cloak, and puts his spectacles down on a rock.

He disappears with a **CRACK.** The other two vampires' jaws dropped at the impossible speed that the eldest flew at.

Another resounding **CRACK** filled the air as the eldest vampire returned to the cave. His cloak was in tatters. His clothes were disheveled. But most prominent was the blood. His entire body was covered in blood. Never would the other vampires imagine that so much blood could cling to one person.

The eldest lets out a sigh, and plops to the ground. He reaches for his glasses, and cleans them with what remains of his cloak.

The younger vampires look at each other, not sure whether to break the silence.

Finally, the youngest asks, ""So...?""

The elder vampire looks up slowly. He murmurs,

""You see that massive tree over there? The one with the widest trunk, as thick as a man is tall?""

Baffled, the youngest replied, ""...Yes?""

The eldest, sheepishly, continued.

""Well, I didn't.""",NSFW

As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.""

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned  a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's  owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his  front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to  bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 		The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few  minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and  also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on  its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the  room.

"What a ""Shitty"" experience All in all, it hadn't been a good day. Bad traffic, a malfunctioning computer, incompetent coworkers and a sore back all made me a seething cauldron of rage. But more importantly for this story, it had been over forty-eight hours since I'd last taken a dump. I'd tried to jumpstart the process, beginning my day with a bowl of bowel-cleansing fiber cereal, following it with six cups of coffee at work, and adding a bean-laden lunch at Taco Bell. As I was returning home from work, my insides let me know with subtle rumbles and the emission of the occasional tiny fart that Big Things would be happening soon. Alas, I had to stop at the mall to pick up an order. I completed this task, and as I was walking past the stores on my way back to the car, I noticed a large sale sign proclaiming, ""Everything Must Go!"" This was prophetic, for my colon informed me with a sudden violent cramp and a wet, squeaky fart that everything was indeed about to go. I hurried to the mall bathroom. I surveyed the five stalls, which I have numbered 0 through 4 (I write a lot of software) for your convenience: 

0.Occupied 

1.Clean, but Bathroom Protocol forbids its use, as it's next to the occupied one. 

2.Poo on seat. 

3.Poo and toilet paper in bowl, unidentifiable liquid splattered on seat. 

4.No toilet paper, no stall door, unidentifiable sticky object near base of toilet. 

Clearly, it had to be Stall #1. I trudged back, entered, dropped trou and sat down. I'm normally a fairly Shameful Shitter. I wasn't happy about being next to the occupied stall, but Big Things were afoot. 

I was just getting ready to bear down when all of a sudden the sweet sounds of Beethoven came from next door, followed by a fumbling, and then the sound of a voice answering the ringing phone. As usual for a cell phone conversation, the voice was exactly 8 dB louder than it needed to be. Out of Shameful habit, my sphincter slammed shut. The inane conversation went on and on. Mr. Shitter was blathering to Mrs. Shitter about the shitty day he had. I sat there, cramping and miserable, waiting for him to finish. As the loud conversation dragged on, I became angrier and angrier, thinking that I, too, had a crappy day, but I was too polite to yak about in public. My bowels let me know in no uncertain terms that if I didn't get crapping soon, my day would be getting even crappier. 


Finally my anger reached a point that overcame Shamefulness. I no longer cared. I gripped the toilet paper holder in one hand, braced my other hand against the side of the stall, and pushed with all my might. I was rewarded with a fart of colossal magnitude -- a cross between the sound of someone ripping a very wet bed sheet in half and of plywood being torn off a wall. The sound gradually transitioned into a heavily modulated low-RPM tone, not unlike someone firing up a Harley. I managed to hit resonance frequency of the stall, and it shook gently. 

- 

Once my ass cheeks stopped flapping in the breeze, three things became apparent: (1) The next-door conversation had ceased; (2) my colon's continued seizing indicated that there was more to come; and (3) the bathroom was now beset by a horrible, eldritch stench. 

It was as if a gateway to Hell had been opened. The foul miasma quickly made its way under the stall and began choking my poop-mate. This initial ""herald"" fart had ended his conversation in mid-sentence. 

""Oh my God,"" I heard him utter, following it with the suppressed sounds of choking, and then, ""No, baby, that wasn't me (cough, gag), you could hear that (gag)??"" 

Next door I could hear fumbling with the paper dispenser as he desperately tried to finish his task. Little snatches of conversation made themselves heard over my anal symphony: ""Gotta go... horrible... throw up... in my mouth.... not... make it... tell the kids... love them... oh God..."" followed by more sounds of suppressed gagging and retching. 

- 

Alas, it is evidently difficulty to hold one's phone and wipe one's bum at the same time. Just as my high-pressure abuse of the toilet was winding down, I heard a plop and splash from next door, followed by a string of swear words and gags. My poop-mate had dropped his phone into the toilet. 

After a considerable amount of paperwork, I got up and surveyed the damage. I felt bad for the janitor who'd be forced to deal with this, but I knew that flushing was not an option. No toilet in the world could handle that unholy mess. Flushing would only lead to a floor flooded with filth. 

As I left, I glanced to the next-door stall. Nothing remained in the bowl. Had he flushed his phone, or had he plucked it out and left the bathroom with nasty unwashed hands? The world will never know. 

I exited the bathroom, momentarily proud and Shameless, looking around for a face glaring at me. But I saw no one. I suspect that somehow my supernatural elimination has manged to transfer my Shamefulness to my anonymous poop-mate. I think it'll be a long time before he can bring himself to poop in public -- and I doubt he'll ever again answer his cell phone in the loo. And this, my friends, is why you should never talk on your phone in the bathroom.

Unfortunately, Dave did not find the stunt very funny. ""JIM! WHAT IS THIS! THEY HATE THE LIONS!"" Jimmy wasn't sure how a bunch of sheep could hate a sports team, but this was not the time to argue with his uncle.

The second day. Jimmy pulled a similar stunt. He bought a dozen Vikings jerseys. He had to dig into his college savings to get the cash. Once again, Uncle Dave was furious. ""JIM! WHAT IS THIS! THEY HATE THE VIKINGS EVEN MORE"" and Jimmy was forced to cut his losses and take the jerseys off.

It was the third day, but Jimmy did not give up. He bought even more jerseys, this time for the Chicago Bears. He even stole the money from his parents to buy them.  If you thought Dale was mad before, this was a whole new level. ""JIM! WHAT THE F*** DID YOU DO! THEY HATE THE BEARS MORE THAN ANY TEAM IN THE WHOLE WORLD!"" But Jimmy wasn't taking this shit anymore. He had worked way too hard to be treated like this. ""WELL WHAT F***ING TEAM DO YOUR DUMBA** SHEEP LIKE THEN!"" He yelled back. ""ISN'T IT OBVIOUS, JIM!""

Many years later, that same teacher was admitted into a hospital due to a rare and potentially fatal heart condition. There is only one doctor in her country that can perform a lifesaving surgery, and he arrives there as soon as possible.

"My autistic cousin came to visit When I was young, my autistic 10 year old cousin would constatly visit us, and I hated him because he was a brat. However, since his parents were extremely protective and thought of him as a little prince, they wanted to make me give him my ""Up"" DVD, because he really likes it.

When they left, I immediately told him I was not going to give him the DVD, but him being the autist he is, he starts bothering me about it every couple of seconds, but luckily, quiets down before dinner.

He asked for it once more while we were having lunch, and when I responded negatively again, he took his plate and ran into my treehouse. His parents make me go check on him.

Little did he know, you were able to remove the treehouse ladder, and since I was 12 at the time, I removed them and went to go get icecream in the house. I'm forced to ask him if he wants some, but when I leave the house, he's there and he thinks he's controlling me because I came to see him twice already, so he tells me to run around like a chicken. I tell him about the ice cream and how he isn't getting any, and he starts crying and screaming at me to let him get back down. I tell him: ""Never gonna give you ""Up"", never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and dessert you.""",SFW

Ya. Or wait? No. Maybe not. I don't remember.

""Any way. This is Chronos' Game. It's called a chronosgasm.""

Basically, the dream was me calculating all the times I could possibly randomly run into all of my friends. We were all going in different directions. I had no control.

I dreamed of every where all of the kids at Tesoro, Las Flores, and Las Naranjos, and The Ranch, and IVC preschool and Sylvan Learning Center and Montessori preschool and my cousin and their cousins and all the eEye workers and their kids and every possible which way and what I realized was I was one marble. And there were infinitely many marbles and infinitely many directions and infinitely many different velocities they could all go. It's how you create a hyperspace jump. One marble against an infinitely many time times an infinitely many possibilities times and infinitely many marbles. Shit is completely undefined. You fire the marble. You have no way of calculating that many projectories. But you can just fire that marble really hard, and as loud as you can make it. 

And then the marbles will always be levitating around you, as you accumulate more mass. But never holding on too tight, letting those marbles disperse. So they can spread. Be good at Goodbyes. 

Leave a Goodbye with some emotion. Or it will really be goodbye. 

Also, you can fucking masturbate obviously that's not a big deal.

The bartender said ‚Äú If you guys aren‚Äôt drinking alcohol, then I‚Äôll have to charge you for the waters.‚Äù

The two scientists both thought about the possibility of making jokes about subatomic particles that would use the term charge in a different way than the bartender. Ultimately they decided not to risk it and ordered some hot wings which although not alcohol still satisfied the need for the establishment to generate income from customers. The bar was named De Cartes Horse, which might mean that geometry jokes would go over better than chemistry puns anyway.

The bartender, Ray, seethed as he placed the order with the cook/ bar back. He caressed the bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide next to his aluminum baseball bat and hoped he would get to use one of these things soon. Since they were hidden below the bar, he could touch them many times throughout the evening. He knew he needed help because his internal dialogue had stopped. He decided not to do anything different that day although he could feel his split brain pouting. 

Ray tried to think back to a time when he didn‚Äôt want to hurt others. Instead he only looked ahead, in one direction and slightly askew to where this would all end up. He couldn‚Äôt see an endpoint.

Harrods had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and Chris unknowingly got the knickers.

Good old Chris sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter.

Dear Maggie,

I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove).

These are a very delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and I hardly noticed any marks.

I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. She also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. In fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them.

I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again.

When you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will be naturally a little damp from wearing.

Just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year.

I hope you will wear them for me on our next date.

All my love,

Chris

The copilot acknowledges, and gives quarter flaps.

As they begin to see the runway through the fog, they start to see how short the runway is. The pilot nervously says ‚ÄúThis runway is shorter than I thought! Give me half flaps, we‚Äôve got to slow this plane down! The copilot, also nervous, gives him half flaps. 

The pilot, beginning to see the runway more clearly now through the fog, starts to panic at how short the runway is. ‚ÄúGive me three quarter flaps!‚Äù He shouts. The copilot gives him three quarter flaps as fast as he can. 

All of a sudden, just as they are about to land, the fog breaks and they can see just how short the runway is. The pilot screams at his copilot ‚ÄúMy god this runway is short! Give me full flaps, or we‚Äôll crash! The copilot gives full flaps at blinding speed, while sweating more than he ever has in his life.

It is getting dark and they are still far away

SM: Have you noticed that a man has been
following us for the past thirty-eight and
a half minutes? I wonder what he wants. 

SL: It's logical. He wants to make love to us. 

SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in
15 minutes at the most! What can we do? 

SL: The only logical thing to do of course is
to walk faster.   A little while later... 

SM: It's not working. 

SL: Of course it's not working. The man did
the only logical thing. He started to walk
faster, too. 

SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he
will reach us in one minute. 

SL: The only logical thing we can do is split.
You go that way and I'll go this way. He
cannot follow us both.

happened to Sister Logical.

SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here!

SL: The only logical thing happened. The man
couldn't follow us both, so he followed me 

SM: Yes, yes! But what happened then? 

SL: The only logical thing happened. I started
to run as fast as I could and he started to run
as fast as he could. 

SM: And? 

SL : The only logical thing happened.
He reached me. 

SM : Oh, dear! What did you do? 

SL : The only logical thing to do. I lifted

"Late last week, I was rushing around trying to get some last minute shopping done. Late last week, I was rushing around trying to get some last minute shopping done. I was stressed out and not thinking very fondly of the Christmas season right then. It was dark, cold, and wet in the parking lot as I was loading my car up with gifts that I felt obligated to buy. I noticed that I was missing a receipt that I might need later, so, mumbling under my breath, I retraced my steps to the mall entrance.

As I was searching the wet pavement for the lost receipt, I heard a quiet sobbing. The crying was coming from a poorly dressed boy about 12 years old. He was short and thin, and had no coat. He was just wearing a ragged flannel shirt to protect him from the cold night's chill. Oddly enough, he was holding a hundred dollar bill in his hand. Thinking that he had gotten lost from his parents, I asked him what was wrong.

He told me his sad story. He said that he came from a large family. He had three brothers and two sisters. His father had died when he was nine years old. His mother was poorly educated and worked two full time jobs. She made very little to support her large family. Nevertheless, she had managed to save two hundred dollars to buy her children Christmas presents. The young boy had been dropped off on the way to her second job. He was to use the money to buy presents for all his siblings and save just enough to take the bus home. He had not even entered the mall, when an older boy grabbed one of the hundred dollar bills and disappeared into the night.
""Why didn't you scream for help?"" I asked.

The boy said, ""I did.""

""And nobody came to help you?"" I wondered. The boy stared at the sidewalk and sadly shook his head.

""How loud did you scream?"" I inquired. The soft-spoken boy looked up and meekly whispered, ""Help me!""

I realized that absolutely no one could have heard that poor boy cry for help. So, I grabbed his other hundred and ran to my car.",SFW

"There's this big hole in the ground These two men are walking through the woods one day and they come across a big hole in the ground. Now this hole is huge, like some sort of endless pit. So the one man says to the other, ‚ÄúI wonder how deep this hole is?‚Äù

He then proceeds to pick up a rock and toss it in the humongous hole. They listen... nothing. The other man then grabs a large stick and throws it in.... Nothing.

At this point the two men are really intrigued over this large hole. So they look around a little for something bigger to throw in, and they come across a railroad tie. They both grab an end, walk it over to the hole, and throw it in.

The men are looking down the hole when all of a sudden they hear this noise in the woods. They look over and see this goat running all over the place. It‚Äôs ziging and zaging between trees and going all over the place. Then it runs right up and dives into the hole.

Now the two men are thinking, what the hell was that? They had no idea what that goat was doing. So they decide to just keep walking.

A little ways down they run into a farmer, and the farmer asks them if they‚Äôd seen his goat. The two men tell him that they saw a goat come running out of the woods and jump into this huge hole. The farmer says, ""that couldn‚Äôt have been my goat, cause I tied my goat to a railroad tie.""",NSFW

"I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend with big tits When I was 13, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend with big tits.

When I was 16, I got a girlfriend with big tits, but there was no passion, so I decided I needed a passionate girl with zest for life.
In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional.
Everything was an emergency; she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.
When I was 25, I found a very stable girl but she was boring.
She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. 
Life became so dull that I decided that I needed a girl with some excitement.

When I was 28, I found an exciting girl, but I couldn‚Äôt keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition. When I turned 30, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground, so I married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

The stage is set, music starts to play and applicant 3 comes out in a tight purple leather suit and sings an incredible rendition of Princes ‚ÄòRed Corvette‚Äô, one of Billys favourite songs. He nails the highs, he nails the lows and it‚Äôs almost flawless. The crowd love it, and the applause-o-metre grades Cromulus at 3,287 clapperoos (the grading point for clapping sound) out of 4000, a great score!

Applicant 1, Jefferson Ford is next. The stage is set and Ford comes out with a tiny motorbike. A giant cage rolls into the centre of the stage, with a dozen bears on more tiny motorbikes, who start riding around. Ford rides up a prepared ramp and backflips into the cage, and starts flying around with all of these bears and motorbikes and it‚Äôs incredible! In the 10 minutes allowed, Ford doesn‚Äôt fall once! Billy thinks this is incredible, with the applause-o-metre grading Ford at 3,699 claperoos out of 4000. Almost perfect!

Applicant 5, Shoeman Shoefan comes out next. The room slowly darkens and a tiny box is brought out onto the stage measuring only 30cm x 30xm x 30cm. Shoeman walks out, in a leotard with a strange mask on in the shape of a moth. A strange music starts to play, echoing across the room. Shoeman starts to slowly twist her body as she climbs into the box. A person of this stature should not fit into such a tiny tiny box like this but Shoeman manages to squeeze into it and close the lid. It is an incredible display of bodily awareness and everyone, Billy included is in complete awe. The applause-o-metre grades Shoeman at 3,100 claperoos exactly, out of 4000. A very impressive score.

Applicant 2 was next but unfortunately fell ill last minute and was unable to attend. They‚Äôre out, and that leaves Applicant 4 remaining. Applicant 4 comes out, head held high. A microphone is placed on stage and the applicant walks up to it, clears his throat¬†and says the following: ‚ÄúTwo peanuts walk into a bar, and one was a salted‚Äù.

Crickets‚Ä¶nobody laughs, a few small claps are heard with a register of only 12 claperoos on the applause-o-metre, and then the room falls silent. Billy stands up and clears his throat, everyone in the room leans forward in anticipation to hear what the big boss has to say. Billy yells out in his booming voice ‚ÄúYOU WIN SIR FOR THAT WAS THE GREATEST JOKE OF ALL TIME!‚Äù",NSFW

The man is fine with this and pays for the item and leaves. As he‚Äôs walking down the road he sees a rat start following him. He thinks that‚Äôs odd but continues on his way.

"The Thanksgiving Story Was told this joke when I was around 7 or 8 and thought it was the shit. Thought you guys might appreciate it as much as 7 year old me did.

&amp;#x200B;

The story starts off 1 week before Thanksgiving. A little boy is playing with some toys on his front porch. All of the sudden some teenagers show up and start dicking around on the lawn. The boy's mother comes out of the house and yells ""Get off my lawn you Bitches and Bastards!"" not realizing her son was sitting right there. All the teenagers scatter. The little boy then asked his mom ""mommy mommy what does bitches and bastards mean?"" The mom responded ""Umm ... boys and girls.""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to that night. The little boy is having trouble sleeping and goes over to his parent's room to get them to help him. He opens their door and walks over to the bed but does not see either of them there. All of the sudden he starts hearing some sounds from the closet. The boy walked over and opened the door. He ended up seeing his parents having sex and moaning ""mmm dicks and vaginas."" The parents realized their kid was standing watching them, and quickly covered themselves up with the first clothing items they could find. The little boy then asked ""Daddy daddy what does dicks and vaginas mean?"" The dad replied ""Umm ... coats and hats.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, thanksgiving day arrives. Both the boy's parents are trying to get nervous as both of their parents are coming over for dinner. The little boy goes upstairs to find his dad shaving in the washroom. The dad then exclaimed loudly ""SHIT!"" because he cut himself by accident. The little boy, being himself asked ""daddy daddy what does shit mean?"" The dad, thinking quick on his feet said ""Shaving.""

&amp;#x200B;

The little boy then went downstairs to try and help his mom in the kitchen. He walks in and sees her carving a turkey. All of the sudden the mom yelled ""FUCK!"" as she cut herself as well. The little boy said ""mommy mommy what does fuck mean?"" The mother, used to her son's questions responded ""cutting.""

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, the doorbell rings. The mom, busy in the kitchen told her son to go get the door. The boy opened the door. It was his grandparents. He immediately said ""Hello bitches and bastards may I please take your dicks and vaginas?"" His grandma said ""Young man, where are your parents!"" The little boy then responded ""well my dad is upstairs shitting himself and my mom's busy in the kitchen fucking the turkey.""",NSFW

"How the Canadians prepare their army A new recruit arrives on the front lines during world war 2. When he gets there he is told resources are stretched thin and they have not rifles to spare him, although they still expect him to go on patrol. He goes straight to his captain and explains the situation, the captain hands him a broom and tells him if he sees any germans to point the broom handle at them and shout ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" to kill them. The recruit thinks this is the most ridiculous thing he has ever heard but he has no choice so he agrees and heads out. While on patrol he comes across a German soldier. The German reaches for his rifle, so with no other option the recruit points his broom and shouts ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" and to his surprise the German drops dead. When he arrives back he immediately thanks the captain.

A couple of weeks went by and our guy had become quite the crackshot, even having a telescopic sight fixed to his broom. One day he was scouting the enemy position from under some bushes when he bumps into a German crawling the other way, in the cramped space he barely manages to point his broom at the German in time, so he returns to his captain and demands a weapon for close quarters combat. The captain takes a piece of string out of his drawer and tells him to hit an enemy with it and shout ""STAB STAB STABBITY STAB"". This time he trusts the captain and sure enough it works great.

Another couple of weeks go by and our guy is a legend. He kills dozens of Germans with his broom and string and receives several awards. One day while on patrol in a forest he sees a crazy German soldier in the distance running towards him and shouting at the top of his voice. He is pretty confident in his abilities, takes careful aim and shouts ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" but the German keeps on coming. He aims again ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" and again nothing. The German is getting really close so he takes out his string, but as he swings it out and shouts ""STAB STAB STABBITY STAB"" the German just runs straight into him, knocking him clear off his feet into a tree and breaking several bones. As he lies there dying the German slows down and comes back for a look. He finds our hero lying crushed on the ground asking how this happened. He laughs, turns around and runs off, resuming his shouts of ""TANK TANK TANKITY TANK"".

"Best Cricket Joke Ever! (Incident described in ""From the Pavilion End"" by
Harold ""Dickie"" Bird)

""Bomber"" Wells, a spin bowler and great character,
played for Glocuestershire and Nottinghamshire. He
used to bat at No.11 since one
couldn't bat any lower. Of him, they used to
paraphrase Compton's famous words describing an
equally inept runner; ""When he shouts 'YES' for a run,
it is merely the basis for further negotiations!""
Incidentally, Compton was no better.

John Warr said, of Compton ""He was the only person who
would call you for a run and wish you luck at the same
time."" Anyway, when Wells played for Gloucs, he had an
equally horrendous runner as the No.10. During a
county match, horror of horrors.......both got
injured.

Both opted for runners when it was their turn to
bat.

Bomber played a ball on the off, called for a run,
forgot he had a runner and ran himself. Ditto at the
other end. In the melee, someone decided that a second
run was on. Now we had all four running. Due to the
confusion and constant shouts of ""YES"" ""NO"",
eventually, *all* of them ran to the same end.

Note - at this point in time, the entire ground is
rolling on the floor laughing their behinds out. One
of the fielders - brave lad - stops laughing for a
minute, picks the ball and throws down the wicket at
the other end. Umpire Alec Skelding looks very
seriously at the four and calmly informs them ""One of
you buggers is out. I don't know which. You decide
and inform the bloody scorers!"". ",NSFW

"An Irishman, a Frenchman, and an Afghani man are riding around the world in a balloon... When they are over Ireland, the Irish man picks up an enormous bag of potatoes and says ‚ÄòI‚Äôm giving my country this bag of potatoes, in hopes that some hungry souls can find happiness from full bellies.‚Äô He tossed the bag of potatoes over the edge of the balloon's basket.

The Frenchman and the Afghani man think giving things to their countries is a wonderful idea. They set course for France where the Frenchman wants to drop an item to bring joy to people.

While over France, the Frenchman picks up a case of wine, and before dropping it over the edge of the basket, he says ‚ÄòI hope that this will be found by some countrymen who have fallen on hard times, and that drinking it and sharing it with friends and family will boost their spirits.‚Äô

On their last stop, Afghanistan, the Irishman and French man are curious what the Afghani man will toss over the edge, as his country is in such peril. Rather than something to bring happiness, the Afghani man picks up a bomb, tossing it out of the basket while cackling. He reveals to his companions that he is a terrorist, and says ‚ÄòI hope this brings misery and suffering!‚Äô

At the end of their balloon voyage (which was probably pretty awkward after Afghanistan), the three men go back to their home countries, hoping to see the difference the items they threw overboard made.

When the Irishman arrived in Dublin, he was horrified to see a large group of orphans begging for change and food scraps outside of the boarded up orphanage where up until recently, they lived. When he asked why the orphanage closed, one of the beggars explained that the kindly woman who ran the orphanage was on her way to pay their rent and pick up food, when a sack of potatoes fell from the sky and crushed her, leaving them homeless and starving.

Meanwhile in Paris, the Frenchmen was horrified when he opened up a newspaper and read about a freak accident at an outdoor wedding. A large case of wine fell from out of the sky, causing the tent the wedding was taking place under to collapse on all the guests and the many lit candles adorning the tables. The tent went up in flames, killing everyone trapped beneath it.

In Kabul, the Afghani terrorist was prowling the streets, looking for the place his bomb had fallen. He soon came to the smouldering wreckage of a building and looked around expectantly for sobbing people and grieving families. Instead, an unpleasant odour filled the air, and he saw a group of people near the blast, covering their noses and laughing hysterically. None were laughing harder than a man in the centre of their group, who had tears running down his face from laughing so hard.

The terrorist was enraged, and asked the man what was so funny. Why weren‚Äôt they wailing in grief? Still laughing, and wiping away tears, the man looked at the terrorist and said ‚ÄòI farted, and the building behind me exploded.‚Äô",NSFW
